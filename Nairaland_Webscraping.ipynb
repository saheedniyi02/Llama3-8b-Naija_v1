When the time came, the chicks hatched, and so did the\\nlittle eagle, who had been kept warm in the same brood.The tiny eagle grew\\nalong with the hatchlings. After some time it learned to cluck and cackle like\\nchickens, to scratch the ground, to look for worms. And he would thrash his\\nwings and fly a few feet into the air onto the lower branches of the bushes,\\njust like all the other chickens.Years passed and the eagle grew very old. One\\nday he saw a magnificent bird above him in the cloudless sky. Up there in the\\nbright blue, this bird glided with graceful majesty among the wind currents,\\nwith scarcely a beat of its strong golden wings.The old eagle was awestruck.\\nIt turned to the nearest chicken and asked, \\\"Who's that?\\\"The chicken looked up\\nand answered, \\\"Oh, that's the golden eagle, the king of the birds. He belongs\\nto the sky. We belong to the earth... we're chickens.\\\"So, the eagle lived and\\ndied a chicken, for that's what he thought he was.Meditation: Do not be\\ndeceived: \\u201cEvil company corrupts good habits.\\u201d \\u2013 1 Corinthians 15:33You will\\nsucceed in Jesus Name!Daily Dew is published by Sons of Issachar Projects.

Genesis 3:19Read: Genesis 3:17-19It is important to keep\\neternity in view as you live on the earth. Another reason people fear death is\\nbecause death seals fate. Once you die, your fate is sealed. Job 7:9-10 says\\nonce a man dies, he cannot come back to his earthly home anymore. In Luke\\n16:19-31, the Lord told a story of a rich man and a poor beggar who lived at a\\nparticular time in life. At some point, they both died. While the fate of the\\nrich man was sealed in hell, that of the poor man was sealed in Heaven. If you\\nare born-again and you die righteous, your fate is sealed in Heaven, but if\\nyou die in your sins, your fate is sealed in hell. 1 Corinthians 10:12\\nsays,\\\"Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall\\\" As\\nlong as you are alive, no matter how strong in the Lord you may be, there is\\nstill the possibility of falling.

All are gifts from his devoted followers. And what about the\\ntattoo of 666 on his arm? Although it's a number usually associated with\\nSatan, not the son of God, de Jesus says that 666 and the Antichrist are, like\\nhim, misunderstood.

              "  'content': 'Though many people seem to have forgotten, I want to remind you today that the\\nwages of sin is still death. Death is a salary for sinners as stated in Romans\\n6:23. The sinner cannot dodge it; you work and you must get paid. Ezekiel\\n18:20 says:“The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the\\niniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son:\\nthe righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of\\nthe wicked shall be upon him.”There are three categories of death. One is\\nphysical death. Sickness is an agent of physical death. In Mark 2:5, Jesus\\nforgave the sin of the paralysed man before healing him. If sin does not get\\nout of the way, sickness would remain and eventually kill the fellow. Jesus\\ntold the man at the pool of Bethesda after healing him that if he went back\\ninto sin, a worse illness would come upon him (John 5:14). Physical death\\ncould come through sickness when sin is in the life of a man.The second\\ncategory of death is material death. In Deuteronomy 28:15-24, there is a list\\nof curses for those who will not obey God. If you read that scripture, you\\nwould be amazed at how many of those curses have to do with poverty. Many\\npeople are wallowing in poverty simply because they refuse to let go of sin.\\nIf only they could turn a new leaf and live holy, they would enjoy great\\nblessings they never thought possible.Lastly, there is spiritual death. This\\nis the most dangerous; it is separation from God. In Genesis 3:8-10, Adam and\\nEve ate the forbidden fruit and the moment they heard the voice of God, they\\nran. God wasn’t the one chasing them; It was their sin. When you commit sin,\\nyou automatically run from God; the intimacy between you and Him is destroyed.\\nOnce the devil sees that you and your protector are now apart, he attacks with\\nall kinds of issues. Spiritual death leads the sinner to eternity in hell. May\\nyou not experience spiritual death in the mighty name of Jesus. Written by\\nPastor E.A. Adeboye.\\n\\n',\n",

The “WAH”\\nbooklet is what contains the plans, purposes of God and prayer programmes for\\nthe following year!I thank God that when He gives me a theme, it has always\\nbeen, “OVER CONFIRMED” each year. He told me 2020 is a year of ELEVATION! But\\njust after the WORLD ANOINTING NIGHT, the CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) began\\nspreading very fast around the world. I then asked the LORD FOR THE CONNECTION\\nBETWEEN CORONAVIRUS and ELEVATION.It was then that He reminded me that great\\ntestimonies are born out of great seasons of agony! He reminded me that Joseph\\nwas ELEVATED in the season of a GREAT WORLD RECESSION and ECONOMIC PAIN (great\\ndrought/famine). He reminded me too that Isaac was ELEVATED and became a world\\nfinancial star, also during a severe world famine! That was when the\\nPhilistines began to envy him.The LORD reminded me also that in Luke 5,\\nPeter’s destiny changed only after a BIG FAILURE and SHAME (he was washing his\\nempty net. He caught nothing. He was frustrated). That was the day the LORD\\ncommissioned (ELEVATED) him to the enviable status of “FISHER OF MEN” (FOM).\\nNo wonder Author, Gail Sheehy, wrote: “To be tested is good.

Bishop Chris spoke about how God can turn the valley of\\ndry BONES into valour. The man of God ministered, prayed and prophesied.His\\nwords:\"Your enemies will make the mistakes of the Jebusites. Those who said\\nyou will never make it in life or get promoted; the God that disgraced the\\nJebusites will disgrace them. They will be alive to see the signs and wonders\\nof God in your life.

Men will wonder when they see you\\nbecause greater grace, progress and speed is coming your way.\"\"People will\\nsuddenly see you rise again. Your life will disappoint and surprise your\\nenemies in Jesus name.\"The Bishop went on to speak about, \"Operation Divine\\nCross.\" He explained how God hid the secret of Jesus\\' death bringing\\nrestoration to mankind: \"From Genesis to the day Jesus died, God hid the\\nsecret (Operation Divine Cross) from Satan. The devil thought that by killing\\nJesus, he had defeated God. In this season, the kingdom of darkness will make\\nmistakes because of you.\"\"Fear not, cry not, trust in the Lord (2 Samuel 5:7).\\nYou will get married, you will get pregnant, you will be healed, you will have\\na testimony, all your prayers and fasting will turn into testimonies. A man\\'s\\nsecret is hidden in his star. May the Lord hide your secrets from your\\nenemy.\"As Bishop Chris ministered, miracles began to occur. He acknowledged\\nthe presence of His three Friends and Jesus as the Healer.Here are a few of\\nthe prophecies and miracles recorded during his ministration.Prophecies:1.\\nDeaf Ears healed.2. Healing of Breast Cancer.Words of Knowledge: 1. Someone\\nhad lost 4 children to death. The Bishop prophesied that she would carry\\nchildren again. He said that the God of restoration had located her and there\\nwould be the sound of joy and celebration again. Affliction would not rise\\nagain the second time. The subject of the prophecy was enjoined to send a\\nwhatsapp message to: *+2349032648292* .2. In the family of an individual\\nsurnamed *RICHARD*, nobody crossed a particular level in life but that yoke\\nwas broken in Jesus name.3. It was prophesied that the life of one *ABIODUN*\\nwas like that of a circle, which was also written as a prayer point. The yoke\\nof going around in circles was broken.4. A word of knowledge came of 21 cars\\nowned by individuals. 5. Victory for an individual who was dragged to court by\\nan insurance company.6. A big celebration and party in the house of an\\nindividual.7. A case of madness healed.8. Remembrance of those who had been\\nabandoned by helpers.9. Enlargement of the coast of many who had been called\\n\"Jabez.\" The incredible to locate the addresses of such people.Bishop Chris\\nwent on to speak about the importance of the bones. He said that the bones are\\nmeant for support; if the enemy can attack the bones, he will attack that\\nlife. Therefore, one should guard jealously and protect anything of value\\nbecause when the enemy dries the bones, that life becomes dried up.Reject the\\nlie by anybody that says that it is impossible to achieve your dream. Instead,\\ncontinue to dream incredible dreams and let your plans be incredible plans.\\nYou will be who you were created to be, you will possess your possessions. The\\nword \"impossible\" is a big word thrown around by small men.Embrace your\\nchildlike wonder and curiosity. Dream the impossible and have solid faith and\\ncourage. Laugh again because the God you serve is a \"God of Nevertheless.\" A\\ndry bone shaking testimony shall be your portion. PRAYER POINTS:1 *. Oh Lord,\\nlet my life, my children, my marital story and career surprise my enemies in\\nJesus name.* 2. *Oh Lord, let satanic kingdoms make the mistakes the Jebusites\\nmade.* 3. *Lord, hide my secrets from my enemies.* 4. *Oh \"God of\\nNevertheless\" answer me by fire. Do for me what you did for Bishop Chris E.\\nKwakpovwe.* The Bishop ended the prayer and fasting session with words of\\nencouragement for the viewers. He spoke about how difficult life was for him\\nwhen he left Pharmacy to full-time ministerial work. Some of the challenges in\\nthat stormy season of his life included the use of firewood for cooking. He\\nwas routinely mocked by people; a particular instance was when someone scorned\\nat his living quarters at that time, comparing his situation to that of his\\ncontemporaries who were in better living conditions and good locations. At\\nsome point, he even harboured the thought of going back to Pharmacy but God\\nwarned him that his life would be at cut short should he resort to such an\\nact. Today, God has turned the tables around and blessed him stupendously; one\\nof such blessings being a beautiful home in an enviable location. His\\nwords:\"God loves you just the way He loves me. Don\\'t lose hope, keep praying\\nand fasting, live a holy life and God will promote you.\"Daily Breaking of\\nFasting and Prayers: Facebook 7pm.Instagram 8pm.Sundays online (YouTube,\\nFacebook and Instagram)8:30am9:40am11: 00am\\n\\n',\n",

And neither did they\\nPREACH nor SERVE God to make Money unlike many GREAT Pastors/Prophets/Church\\nfounders today, who have become extremely RICH by preaching the gospel:1Tim.\\n6:5 ... Their minds are CORRUPT, and they DON\\'T TELL the truth. To them\\nreligion is just a WAY TO GET RICH.As much as I need to check myself, and\\nthoroughly judge my OWN life on this subject, I need to also check that in\\nothers, \"especially\" Christian leaders/Church founders. Because if I follow\\nthe Blind, WE shall both END UP in the ditch (Eternity in Hell). Matt.\\n15:14However, someone might get offended and say, \"Hey, the Bible says JUDGE\\nNOT, so mind your business!\" (As in Matt. 7:1)Right, but that\\'s an incomplete\\ntruth. It says further down in verse 5 of that same chapter, \"FIRST remove the\\nlog in our own eyes (oneself), THEN you shall be able to SEE CLEARLY the\\nproblems of others and help them. The lesson there is judge yourself FIRST:\\ndon\\'t be a Hypocrite, judging others when you are also an UNREPENTANT\\nsinner.Moreover, have you not read 1 John 4:1John.4.1 - Beloved, DO NOT\\nBELIEVE every spirit, but TEST the \"spirits\", whether they are of God; because\\nMANY FALSE Prophets have \"gone out\" into the world.That\\'s very clear.And since\\nI\\'ve got light on all that, I\\'ve been having very Little to ZERO \"spiritual\"\\nrespect for many small and so-called GREAT Preachers/Pastors/Church founders\\nof today. Some of whom I used to esteem VERY highly before. Who have Monetized\\nor Commercialized the Gospel for themselves, DECEIVING \"the weak and the\\nlukewarm\".Titus.1.11- NLT... Such teachers ONLY want your MONEY.Jude.1.11 -\\nNLT... Like Balaam, they will do anything for MONEY.I had to use the phrase\\n\"weak and lukewarm\" because I know it takes REAL diligence or ZEAL for the\\nTruth: the Fear God (and not of Men) to take a STAND, and escape their\\n\"strange grip\" or STRONGHOLD on oneself. Otherwise, we got to just continue in\\ntheir lukewarmness and DECEPTION of serving Money, People, Politicians,\\nPleasures, etc. But yet, having some forms of godliness: CORRECT doctrines,\\ngood dressing or appearance, Church activities, etc.2Pet.2.3 - In their GREED\\nthey will \"make up\" CLEVER LIES to get hold of your MONEY. But God condemned\\nthem long ago, and \"their destruction\" is on the way.Did you notice the phrase\\nCLEVER LIES above?Exactly, that\\'s how these Great Men \"cook up\" interesting\\nLIES to get HUGE MONEY from the POOR and the Rich today. They\\'ll spend hours\\npreaching on Old Covenant TITHING, First Fruits Laws, Monetary Vows and Sowing\\nof seeds, etc of which Jesus and his Apostles didn\\'t ask nor EVEN preach\\nabout. And if they must preach the truth, it\\'s mere Words, not real in their\\nnormal lives:Matt.23.3 - NLT... For they don\\'t PRACTISE what they TEACH.Now,\\nthe main problem is this, MANY professing Christians just SIT there with them\\nwith their mouths WIDELY OPENED: \"Wow, what a \"great\" man of god!\"No, he\\'s\\nnot, I MUST confess. But if by GREAT you mean like that of Celebrities, World\\nRulers, Superstars or Idols, etc. Then Fine, that\\'s absolutely Right! Except\\nfor the Religious whitewash he puts on it. But regarding such as a TRUE Man of\\nGod: FAR from it! I say, these Men LOVE MONEY and the Honour of the World;\\neven tell Religious LIES: ignoring the COMPLETE truth of the New Testament\\nGospel, to preach a CLEVERLY MIXED Old covenant gospel in order to make Huge\\nMoney and live in Grand Styles; and yet, you call them \"followers\" of Jesus?\\nWell, I\\'m not EVEN SURE if they\\'re truly CONVERTED yet, or maybe they\\'re now\\nbackslidden and LOST.Because Jesus said:Matt.6.24 - \"No one can SERVE TWO\\nMasters; ... You CANNOT SERVE God and MAMMON.It\\'s that simple.But show me a\\nMan or Men like Paul and other Apostles of Christ: who planted Churches and\\nshowed good examples by working with their OWN HANDS to Preach the gospel,\\neven though they had THE POWER to get Money (lawfully) from the believers they\\nwere serving:Acts.20.33 - NLT\"I have NEVER COVETED anyone\\'s MONEY or fine\\nclothing.2Thess.3.7 - For you yourselves know how it is necessary to IMITATE\\nour examples...2Thess.3.8 - Nor did we EAT anyone \\'s bread WITHOUT PAYING for\\nit, but \"with toil and struggle WE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY\", that we might NOT BE\\nA BURDEN or impose on any of you... (Financially or Money wise).Men like these\\nare the True Men of God. Not out for Money and the honour of Men, but for\\nReality of the Love and the Fear of God. Great Men who didn\\'t go about\\npreaching Old covenant TITHING, and even threatening people with CURSES in\\norder to get the POOR\\'s Money. In the same vein, we must FIRST watch out for\\nour OWN selves inwardly and REPENT of all unchristlikeness: Sins. Asking God\\nfor grace to overcome in all things, so as not get MISLED by False Men in the\\nWorld.Alas, MANY of these erring Men may never be willing to REPENT of their\\nevil ways, as long as it involves Money (remember Balaam and Judas). But only\\nto look for more and more LIES; twisting Bible verses to \"justify\" their\\nGREED.Finally:However, sufficient is the teachings of Jesus and the Apostles.\\n(In the books of Matthew to Revelation)2Thess.3.6 - But we COMMAND YOU,\\nbrethren, in the NAME of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you WITHDRAW from \"every\\nbrother\" (might even be a Pastor/Church founder) WHO walks \"disorderly\" and\\nNOT according to the \"tradition\" which he RECEIVED from us.2Tim.3.1 - But know\\nthis, that in the last days perilous times will come:2Tim.3.2 - For Men will\\nbe LOVERS of themselves, LOVERS of MONEY, boasters, PROUD...2Tim.3.5 - HAVING\\nA FORM of godliness but DENYING its power. And from such people TURN\\nAWAY!2Tim.4.10 - for Demas has FORSAKEN ME, having LOVED \"this Present\\nWorld\"...2Tim.3.13 - But \"Evil Men\" (Money and Popularity minded Men) and\\nimpostors will grow Worse and WORSE, DECEIVING and being DECEIVED.1Tim.6.9 -\\nBut people who long to be rich FALL into temptation and are TRAPPED by many\\nfoolish and harmful desires...1Tim.6.6 - Yet TRUE religion with \"contentment\"\\nis GREAT WEALTH.May the Lord Jesus bless you.\\n\\n',\n",

The miracles that took place in the desert\\nwill reoccur” he notes.“The divine presence will leave the diaspora and will\\ncome here to protect us” the rabbi said. “There’s a reason that there’s so\\nmuch chaos in the world and that is because God has abandoned all of the\\nbeauty and glory of the nations. (Israel) will be the place where all of the\\nbeauty and glory is found.”“Between Yom Kippur 2022-2023 the Messiah will make\\nhis second appearance and we will see the final redemption.” The rabbi added\\nas a disclaimer that the Messiah can theoretically arrive sooner but that he\\nis basing his analysis on the Kabbalistic teachings of the Ramchal as well as\\nthe Talmud.https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/155103/israeli-rabbi-reveals-\\ndate-of-messiahs-arrival-according-to-\\nkabbalah/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm;_medium=email&utm;_content=Out+Of+The+Realm+of+Your+Understanding+%E2%9C%A1+%22In+this+too+is+my+salvation%22&utm;_campaign=I365+-+DAILY+-+JULY+21,+2020\\n\\n',\n",

Romans 3:23 (NLT)THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: Iniquity has the\\ncapacity to pull down. It is a weight that grounds a person.In our previous\\nstudies, we discovered that uprightness of character is a lifter of people.\\nUprightness makes people dwell in the sphere where God dwells, that is, the\\nhigh places of the earth (Psalm 15:1-2). It is uprightness of life that lifted\\nAbraham, Joseph and Daniel, and positioned them in the realm of relevance in\\ntheir generation. Today, we shall look at another profit of\\nuprightness:Uprightness of character eliminates the gravitational pull of\\niniquity.Iniquity carries a gravitational pull; iniquity is a spiritual\\ngravitational force. Iniquity is a weight. This is why the Scripture\\nadmonishes us in Hebrews 12:1 that we should lay aside every weight. Weight is\\na function of gravity. Iniquity has the capacity to pull people down. It is a\\nweight that grounds a person. Weight is like a heavy stone that can crush a\\nperson. When a heavy stone is thrown up, do you expect it to remain up? No. It\\nmust land. In the same way, iniquity is a weight that pulls a person\\ndown.Romans 3:23 says, For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\\nThe New Living Translation renders it thus: For everyone has sinned; we all\\nfall short of God's glorious standard. So, sin makes people fall. This is why\\nit is usually said that when people sin, they fall into; to sin is to\\nfall.Now, what made Vashti, the queen of the Persian Empire, to fall was sin.\\nShe was right up as the first lady of an empire that covered one hundred and\\ntwenty provinces, stretching from Ethiopia to India, but she fell by the twin\\nsin of rebellion and arrogance. Her husband, the King, asked her to come and\\nshow up her beauty to some royal guests at the King’s banquet, but she refused\\n(Esther 1:10-12). That was how Queen Vashti crashed by the gravitational pull\\nof iniquity. Iniquity was also responsible for the crash of Lucifer. Isaiah\\n14:12 says, How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\\nhow art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! Samson\\nalso fell from grace to grass by the gravitational pull of iniquity (Judges\\n16:20-21). But when you walk in uprightness, that gravitational pull is\\neliminated. Beloved, refuse to be pulled down in life by sin. Avoid the\\nlifestyle of iniquity that pulls people down in life.Remember this: Iniquity\\nhas the capacity to pull down.

              "  'content': 'When a narcissist becomes a church leader \"his continued proximity to God\\nconfers on him authority.\" Priests, leaders of the congregation, preachers,\\nevangelists, \" when they are narcissists, derive authority from their\\nallegedly privileged relationship with God. Religious authority allows the\\nnarcissist to indulge his sadistic urges and to exercise his misogynism freely\\nand openly. Such a narcissist is likely to taunt and torment his followers,\\nhector and chastise them, humiliate and berate them, abuse them spiritually,\\nor even sexually. The narcissist whose source of authority is religious is\\nlooking for obedient and unquestioning slaves upon whom to exercise his\\ncapricious and wicked mastery. The narcissist transforms even the most\\ninnocuous and pure religious sentiments into a cultish ritual and a virulent\\nhierarchy. He preys on the gullible. His flock become his hostages. Religious\\nauthority also secures the narcissist\\'s Narcissistic Supply. His\\ncoreligionists, members of his congregation, his parish, his constituency, his\\naudience - are transformed into loyal and stable Sources of Narcissistic\\nSupply. They obey his commands, heed his admonitions, follow his creed, admire\\nhis personality, applaud his personal traits, satisfy his needs (sometimes\\neven his carnal desires), revere and idolize him. Moreover, being a part of a\\n\"bigger thing\" is very gratifying narcissistically. Being a particle of God,\\nbeing immersed in His grandeur, experiencing His power and blessings first\\nhand, communing with him - are all Sources of unending Narcissistic Supply.\\nThe narcissist becomes God by observing His commandments, following His\\ninstructions, loving Him, obeying Him, succumbing to Him, merging with Him,\\ncommunicating with Him - or even by defying him (the bigger the narcissist\\'s\\nenemy - the more grandiosely important the narcissist feels).Like everything\\nelse in the narcissist\\'s life, he mutates God into a kind of inverted\\nnarcissist. God becomes his dominant Source of Supply. He forms a personal\\nrelationship with this overwhelming and overpowering entity - in order to\\noverwhelm and overpower others. He becomes God vicariously, by the proxy of\\nhis relationship with Him. He idealizes God, then devalues Him, then abuses\\nHim.

If so, you\\'re not alone. Narcissists are\\ninfamous for using religion to manipulate, control and absolutely dominate you\\nthrough fear of what will happen to you if you don\\'t do what they want. In\\nthis video, Narcissists and Religious Abuse (AKA Spiritual Abuse): When\\nNarcissists Use Religion to Control You, I\\'ll define religious abuse and\\noutline how narcissists use it against you.The official definition of\\nreligious/spiritual abuse:Religious abuse is abuse administered under the\\nguise of religion, including harassment or humiliation, which may result in\\npsychological trauma. Religious abuse may also include misuse of religion for\\nselfish, secular, or ideological ends such as the abuse of a clerical\\nposition.I will also talk about how depression can be a side-effect of the\\nCPTSD you get after experiencing a toxic relationship with a narcissist and\\ndealing with the gaslighting, repeating discards, narcissistic rage and other\\nmanipulation tactics used by religious narcissists.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlxPkSADkIM\\n\\n',\n",

At times, financial breakthrough does not stands\\non the amount of the wealth you were able to gather but the ability to\\nmultiply and administer it wisely. Why do we have many spiritual churches\\ntoday without financial capability?Though we can pray hard, fast hard, preach\\nhard, work hard, though we can learn hard but poverty is fighting us, why?, I\\npray that may the Lord open the eye of our understanding in Jesus name.

Many have believed that they can no longer be great or lead\\nbetter lives because of their present situation.And fate, as some would call\\nit, has made some to conclude that their present situation is what God has\\ndestined them to be. Many have been defeated by lust, pride, sexual\\nimmorality, and the pursuit of vanity and they have concluded that there is no\\nhope to rise again.Can destiny be changed? They inquire and accept whatever\\nlife throws at them as their destiny.But I bring you good news.What is that\\nthing that has got your back to the ground?Could it be your family background,\\nnegative marital experience, marital delay, or the unfavorable circumstances\\nof life? Get up! I don\\'t know what has discouraged you from rising, but I\\nbring you a word of hope: you can rise again. These things would, however,\\nfire you up to rise.1. To rise, you need to know and believe what God has said\\nconcerning you. The thought He has for you is the thought of good and not of\\nevil, but to give you an expected end (Jer. 12:11).It is not God\\'s will for\\nyou to live in depression, hopelessness, despair, or confusion. He wants a\\nbetter life for you. But if you do not know what His word says, you will\\naccept whatever men say and what you think in your thought.2. See the bright\\nside of life.Being negative or pessimistic would make you relapse in defeat.\\nNo one rises in life by embracing negative thoughts. You can\\'t make it when\\nyou admit you can\\'t.Believe you can, and you will be empowered to rise.3.\\nEncourage yourself in the LordDavid, a man after God\\'s heart and a mighty man\\nof valor returned from battle a day but to discover that his family and those\\nwith him had been kidnapped.He wept. It may not be bad for you to cry, but he\\ndid one thing.He encouraged himself in the Lord.To be encouraged, be grateful\\nfor life, give thanks, and seek His face on what to do to get up. After he\\nprayed, he found the strength to rise and pursued his enemies until he\\nrecovered all that was stolen (1 Sam. 30).4. Don\\'t look up to menWhen the\\nwriter of Psalms 121 needed help, he said, \"I will lift up my eyes to the\\nhills from where comes my help? My help comes from the Lord, which made heaven\\nand earth (vs. 1-2).Would this be your testimony?When you look up to men to\\nrise, you will end up disappointed. But those who look up to God for help are\\nnever disappointed.If you put your trust in men for help, they will thrust you\\ndown, but when you put your trust in God, He will never suffer your foot to be\\nmoved.5. Never accept defeatNo man wins a battle by conceding to defeat. Every\\nwinner, in spite of their defeat, chose to fight until they win.Have you tried\\nto rise, yet you fall? Have you tried to succeed in life but your efforts were\\ngreeted with failure?Abraham Lincoln did not embrace his defeat. He never gave\\nup until he became the president of the United States of America, regardless\\nof his failures.It is not a failure that hinders a man from success. A man\\nbecomes a failure when he chose to embrace defeat - failure.Do you know it\\ndoesn\\'t matter how old you are now? What really matters is your heart and your\\nactions. If life knocks you down, get up. Winners don\\'t quit trying, but\\nlosers quit.Who says you can\\'t get up and succeed in life? Who had looked down\\non you and concluded it is over for you? What are those negative words that\\nhave been hurled at you, and have now become a stronghold in your mind?Get\\nup!Know what God says concerning your life in His word. Believe it. Be\\noptimistic. Encourage yourself in God. Never concede to defeat. Look up to God\\nand don\\'t put your confidence in men.Remember, He counts on you to deliver\\nmany and fulfill destiny, where are you?

              "  'content': '[b][/b]Francis and I met at the airport. There was a delay due to bad weather.\\nWe got talking and he told me this inspiring story. “My parents had always\\ntold me that life was not easy. My father for one would go on with the sordid\\njourney he took in becoming a man, marrying my mother and raising us.\\nConsequently, I imbibed that mentality that nothing in life comes easy. But,\\non the other hand, my father taught me how to live with hope even when there\\nseems to be no one in sight within my horizon. These two lessons became the\\nfocal point of the life that I pursued.” It was over one hour since we started\\nwaiting. Francis flashed a look at his wristwatch and went on. “When my father\\ndied, this was two years after my mother left, I became heartbroken and\\ndesolate. I was born in the time before the war. Education was not at the top\\nof the list of the average Igbo family. The war came and we emerged from it\\nstriving so hard to make ends meet. When I could not find a good job owing to\\nthe visible challenges in the post-civil war era, I picked up my late father\\'s\\njalopy and entered into the taxi business. Less than two months into the\\nbusiness I was involved in a fatal accident that took the lives of two\\npassengers in the other vehicle. The taxi was damaged beyond recognition and I\\nwas told it could never be fixed. I almost lost one of my eyes. Till date,\\nthat eye became impaired and my vision became partial.”The announcer came on\\nand with the usual foreign accent, those going to Lagos were told to get ready\\nto onboard. Francis continued, “I was warned never to drive again. Luckily, an\\nold family friend got a job for me at the printing press. I felt good at the\\nstart and I gave the job my best to make sure that I remained in favour of the\\nwhite men who managed it. Another disaster struck again- one night I forgot to\\nmonitor the printing press and went to sleep. The machine malfunctioned and\\nmessed up a printing job for a political campaign. That job was to be\\nsubmitted the week before but it was delayed for some reason. But I ended up\\nmessing it further on the eve of the delivery date. I was fired the next\\nmorning. My situation began to look irremediable like a fish struggling for\\nlife on the bare floor. I was fired from two subsequent jobs within two years.\\nI was lost between two opinions; whether the problem was from me or with the\\nsystem that hired and fired me at will. In simple terms, I can say it was like\\na Sisyphean struggle”He said, \"There were perilous moments in my life but I\\nkept thinking when things became very tough for me, ‘Father would have\\nexpected me to keep hope alive. I won\\'t give in to despair’At this point, we\\nwere told that our delayed flight had arrived. Francis concluded, “It got so\\nbad that family and friends started telling me that I lacked the preparedness\\nand discipline to keep a job. They conveyed the impression that I was the\\nproblem and advised me to return to the village and start tilling my father\\'s\\nland. My uncle told me I had no business with a paid job and he charged me to\\nreturn to the village and do something with my life. That thinking got to me\\none day that thoughts of suicide came up as options. But I pushed back at\\nthose voices in my head and kept hoping that one good fortune would change it\\nall. It didn\\'t take long before my prayers were answered. One day, I came\\nacross an advert on the pages of the newspaper. I submitted an application and\\nit was a success. Like you see in a science fiction movie, months became\\nmonths and months elongated to years. I later left the printing job and\\nstarted my own printing business after serving my employer for 15 meritorious\\nyears. Presently, we are bursting our budgets in all financial indices. We are\\non course to extend our business beyond the shores of our nation.”\\nREFLECTIONAs a kid, one of my best moments was watching the aeroplanes take\\noff. Now an adult, I alluded this take off to the same way people allow hope\\nto grow wings and fly out of their lives. The moment you let hope go, the\\ncentrifugal force that tethers grace and joy, alongside hope, in a tripartite\\narrangement existing at the core of your system disintegrates. I recall\\nvividly the miracle of Dammam. It was that one goal, and the first one, that\\nthe Flying Eagles pulled back after being 0-3 down that gave them that flicker\\nof hope. The rest became history. Therefore, it doesn\\'t matter how many times\\nyour life has been messed up by either you or the system. What matters is your\\nresolve to keep pushing in spite of the difficulties. No matter how bad or\\ntortuous the journey has been, just hang on and seek for that one thing that\\nwill keep creating that flicker of hope. For the Eagles of Nigeria, it was\\nthat first goal that whispered in their ears, ‘we can do it. You’ve still got\\ntime’. Look for that first goal that would help you turn your situation\\naround!Plenty of goodies await you if you make it to the end of the tunnel.\\nAnd always remember that after the night, comes the sun that brightens the day\\nand illuminates our life.For more, visit;https://anekearinzeblog.com\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': \"[b][/b]A couple of years back, I was driving from my city of residence to\\nanother major city in a faraway state. The journey was to take me about four\\nhours (on average) driving through the federal highway. Before I set out, I\\nmade sure my vehicle was in the right shape. I hit the road and was cruising\\ntowards my location. Aside from the bumpy part of the road, I was having a\\nstress free journey until I noticed something that caused me some distress.I\\nlooked at the dashboard and noticed a warning indicator blinking on my fuel\\ngauge; my fuel had gone into the reserve. And I could not see a fuel station\\nin sight. I knew the reserve could take me through another 20 miles but that\\ncalmness I had all these while sublimed into thin air. I began to pay serious\\nattention to everything I did; I switched off the air conditioner, I slowed my\\nbreaking acceleration to conserve fuel. Within a few minutes, I lost all the\\ncomposure and calm I had about my trip. I knew what I had in my reserve could\\ntake me some distance before I ran completely out of fuel but for the fact\\nthat I did not know how close the next fuel station was, it got on my nerves.\\nI had to park my vehicle to avoid the engine sucking in some air that could\\nresult in damages that could cost me more money. Memories of people packing\\ntheir vehicles and running out with a gallon in hand in search of the closest\\nfuel station flashed through my mind. The difference this time was that I\\nfound myself in a location that was highly dreaded because of the recent\\nactivities of hoodlums within the vicinity. I knew right away that I had\\ngoofed; I did not pay attention to the volume of fuel in my tank vis-a-vis the\\ndistance I was to take that day.My day switched from good to worse in a\\ntwinkle; this is just how life is. REFLECTIONDo not run your life until you\\nare left with just little in your human reserve. Just like the situation I got\\nmyself into with my car, I have seen people live their lives with neither a\\nplan nor a purpose. They simply go rudderless and continue to live as the\\nspirit leads them until one day, they flash a look at their version of the\\nfuel gauge and realize they have gone into 'reserve mode'. Much like I scaled\\ndown the volume of activities to conserve consumption, you see people reset to\\na mediocre way of living to accommodate whatever value they have left in their\\nlife’s tank. They switch off the air conditioner of their lives, slow down on\\nactivities that could bring them more wealth (due to paucity of funds) and are\\nforced into reducing their standard of living all in a bid to accommodate the\\nresources at hand.No matter how much you make, you will definitely run into\\ntrouble if you do not save a part of it. What you save (and then invest)\\ndetermines how much you store in your reserve. Your reserve should have in it\\nat least your basic monthly expense for six months. You must keep an eye on\\nit. Do not run out of fuel in the middle of nowhere.Keep your eyes on the\\ndashboard of life!For more inspirational short\\nstories:https://anekearinzeblog.com\\n\\n\",\n",

Don't think I didn't put in my best. I went for private\\nclasses and read whatever was recommended on the curriculum by the examining\\nbody. But it wasn't going to be. While I was insisting on studying law, my\\nimmediate younger sister gained admission and graduated with a degree in Mass\\nCommunication. The other two younger siblings (both males) would gain\\nadmissions while I was patiently but frustratingly waiting. My siblings\\ngetting ahead of me academically moved me down the pecking order of relevance.\\nThere was a time we all put in some requests for funds.

My father didn't\\neven wait to be cheated out of my birthright as it happened with Jacob and\\nEsau- in fact, he was a key accomplice. He became the orchestrator of this\\nrobbery. My siblings were then assumed to have more informed and superior\\nopinions while mine became second class opinions. It got to a near boiling\\npoint that I decided that I had taken enough. I purchased an entry form and\\nrequested to study French in one of the national universities. Even though it\\nwasn't said to my face, I knew that my younger siblings made a mockery of my\\nchoice of course of study. I ended up spending four years at the university\\nstudying French as a language. The choice of French as a course of study\\ndidn't sit down well with my parents. To make even more mockery of the\\nsituation, they christened me 'Charles De Gaulle'. They claimed that I took\\nthe easy way out of my misery. It was a good punch but sadly they got me\\nsomewhere below the belt”Aliyu looked at his time. I knew his mind was on the\\nFriday prayers at the mosque.

One day at the camp, we were informed that\\nrepresentatives from a multinational firm would be in the camp to conduct\\naptitude tests for qualified candidates for advertised positions in the firm.\\nThe day for the test came but I was not selected for the test. I was bypassed\\nbecause I did not meet certain criteria. While the team was about to leave,\\none of them returned and whispered something to the Camp Commandant. After a\\nshort deliberation, the commandant asked for the public address system and\\nspoke to us. He requested for those that studied French to step out. By sheer\\nprovidence, I was the only one out of the multitude in the campground that had\\na degree in French. I later realized that they needed someone in their\\naffiliate office in France. To summarize my story, that was how I found myself\\nin France and I have been working with the firm for fifteen years. I am in\\nNigeria for an official project. I hope to be back next week”REFLECTIONIt is\\none thing for one to realize he is living a mediocre life but another thing to\\ntake that decision(action) that shows that you have had enough. The antithesis\\nto change is doing the same thing, the same way repetitively. We cannot expect\\nour present condition to change if we decide to let things remain the way they\\nare. Aliyu did nothing about his situation until he became angry. You must be\\nfed up with a situation that does not fit into your plans for your mindset to\\ndemand for a corresponding desperate change. If not, that compelling situation\\nwould remain by your side as a friend until you get angry and sever the\\nrelationship. You must get angry and let that situation know that you have had\\nenough. And then take action!For more:https://anekearinzeblog.com\\n\\n\",\n",

John 14:12 KJVDuring the three year ministry of Jesus, he did\\nmany mighty things, which proved that he was, truly, the son of God. People\\nthought he was a man until they witnessed his mighty works. Even his disciples\\nwere surprised when he performed some miracles that were beyond their\\nimagination.No man could ever imagine that another person besides Jesus would\\nbe able to perform greater miracles than him. Before the feast of the\\npassover, Jesus changed the mindsets of his disciples when he told them that\\nthey could do better works than him if they believe on him.They wouldn’t have\\nbelieved that they could be better than him if another person besides Jesus\\nrevealed it to them.Who would have imagined another person performing greater\\nmiracles than the Son of God?After the ascension of Jesus Christ, his\\ndisciples began to do greater works than him, which confirmed his words in\\nJohn 24:12. As long as you believe him, you will do greater works than him. It\\nmay seem unbelievable, but it is true because God is not a man that he should\\nlie.Once you doubt your ability to do greater works than him, Jesus, you won’t\\nbe able to do it, no matter your relationship with him.What, then, are the\\nunbelievable things you can do if you believe on him?1. You Can Raise the\\nDead.14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.15 And I am glad\\nfor your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe;\\nnevertheless let us go unto him.16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus,\\nunto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.17 Then\\nwhen Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.18\\nNow Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:19 And many of\\nthe Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.20\\nThen Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but\\nMary sat still in the house.21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou\\nhadst been here, my brother had not died.22 But I know, that even now,\\nwhatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.23 Jesus saith unto\\nher, Thy brother shall rise again.24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he\\nshall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.25 Jesus said unto her, I\\nam the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were\\ndead, yet shall he live:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall\\nnever die. Believest thou this?27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe\\nthat thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.28\\nAnd when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister\\nsecretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.29 As soon as she\\nheard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.30 Now Jesus was not yet come\\ninto the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.31 The Jews then\\nwhich were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that\\nshe rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the\\ngrave to weep there.32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him,\\nshe fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my\\nbrother had not died.33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews\\nalso weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was\\ntroubled.34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come\\nand see.35 Jesus wept.36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!37 And\\nsome of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,\\nhave caused that even this man should not have died?38 Jesus therefore again\\ngroaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon\\nit.39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was\\ndead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead\\nfour days.40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou\\nwouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?41 Then they took away\\nthe stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his\\neyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.42 And I knew\\nthat thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said\\nit, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.43 And when he thus had\\nspoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.44 And he that was\\ndead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound\\nabout with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. John\\n11:14 – 44 KJVJust as Jesus rose Lazarus, from dead, who was dead for four\\ndays, so Paul and Peter rose Eutychus and Tabitha respectively. That confirmed\\nthe words of Jesus in John 14:12, which says we can do whatever Jesus did when\\nhe was on earth.As long as you can raise the dead, you can do it. So many\\nChristians have attended burial ceremonies without ever thinking of raising\\nthe person who brought unstoppable tears from the attendees. Perhaps, you\\ndoubt your ability in Christ when you saw the lifeless body in a coffin.If you\\ndon’t want to do it, you may be call upon when you don’t expect it. Peter\\ndidn’t know someone, Tabitha, was dead when he was in Lydda. Moreover, he was\\nnot prepared when some disciples at Joppa sent for him.You don’t need to be\\nprepared before you do the works of Christ. As long as you believe his words\\nstated in John 14:12, you can do great works — even greater works than Jesus\\nChrist.Paul didn’t know Eutychus would die when he preached at Troas. You may\\nbe caught unaware; never wait till you are called to raise dead.Exercise your\\nfaith in the word of God by raising anyone who is lifeless around you. What is\\nthe essence of the faith you have that can not raise the dead. God is counting\\non you to perform better miracles than him.Furthermore, you can rise the dead\\nwhichever way the Holy Spirit lay in your heart. Jesus commanded Lazarus after\\nhe prayed. Peter did likewise when he rose Tabitha, Dorcas, from dead.\\nHowever, Paul fell on Eutychus — this was exactly what Elijah, in 1 Kings\\n17:17-21, did when he rose the son of the widow of Zarephath — when he rose\\nhim from dead.The Holy Spirit will tell you the method when you are about to\\nraise any lifeless person. However, do not expect Holy Spirit to talk to you\\nif you are not taking Jesus on his words.2. You Can Make the Elements of\\nNature Obey You. Jesus walked on water23 And when he was entered into a ship,\\nhis disciples followed him.24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the\\nsea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.25\\nAnd his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we\\nperish.26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?\\nThen he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great\\ncalm.27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even\\nthe winds and the sea obey him! Matthew 8:23 – 27 KJV.25 And at midnight Paul\\nand Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.26\\nAnd suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the\\nprison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's\\nbands were loosed. Acts 16: 25 – 26 KJVJesus walked on water; thereby,\\nconfirming the kind of person he was. Moreover, he rebuked the winds and the\\nsea, and they remained calm. According to his words in John 14:12, you can\\nrebuke the elements of nature.When you speak believing the words of Jesus,\\nelements or forces of nature have no choice than to obey you. Paul and Silas\\nshook the foundation of the prison with songs and prayers. They proved\\nelements or forces of nature could come to our aid when we are in trouble.The\\nJailer was surprised, but Paul and Silas were not moved. When Jesus rebuked\\nthe wind and sea, the disciples were surprised because — at that time — he had\\nnot informed them about their ability if they believe on him.It shouldn’t\\nsurprise when you come across group of Christians in any part of the world\\npraying against the element or force of nature, which may hinder whatever\\ntheir program. You may not even pray before you stop an element of nature. You\\ncan start or stop them if you believe the words of Jesus.3. You Can Provide\\nMoney or Food in a Miraculous way. Peter brought out money in the mouth of\\nfish24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money\\ncame to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?25 He saith, Yes.\\nAnd when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What\\nthinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or\\ntribute? of their own children, or of strangers?26 Peter saith unto him, Of\\nstrangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.27\\nNotwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an\\nhook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his\\nmouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me\\nand thee.Matthew 17: 24 – 27 KJVI’ve heard some pastors preached on how God\\nprovided for people by giving them idea, which transmuted to cash. They made\\nthe people believe God cannot give a physical cash.Truth be told, their sermon\\nwas motivational, but it was not biblical. Who told you God could not provide\\na physical cash? When Jesus told Peter get money from the mouth of fish, they\\nwas no money in the mouth of the fish. If Jesus could do it, his word says you\\ncan do better than him.You can provide money in a miraculous way, not only\\nwhen God gives you an idea, but also when you believe on his word.There were\\ncookers when the children of Israel ate Manna in the wilderness. Where did\\nthey see Manna?It came directly from heaven. It may sound magical, but it’s\\nreal. If you pray for provision, you may be surprised to see the provision in\\na seemingly magical way. God may not send someone as he sent the widow of\\nZarephath to Elijah. He can put the money you requested in your wardrobe or\\ncar, anywhere, as he put a Shekel in the mouth of fish for the payment of tax.\\nHe can make it drop from heaven as he rained Manna from heaven — God is the\\nsame yesterday, today and forever. It will only happen in the proportion of\\nyour faith in his words.Don’t let motivational speakers decrease your faith.\\nOf course, God can give you idea ( I don’t dispute that) on how to make money.\\nAlso, he can give you money or any material substance directly from him to you\\nwithout giving you idea — it all depends on your faith.\\nhttps://witnessbearer..com/2020/07/3-unbelievable-things-you-can-do-\\nas.html?m=1\\n\\n\",\n",

Ezekiel 28:13-17 You\\nlived in Eden, the garden of God, and wore gems of every kind: rubies and\\ndiamonds; topaz, beryl, carnelian, and jasper; sapphires, emeralds, and\\ngarnets. You had ornaments of gold. They were made for you on the day you were\\ncreated. I put a terrifying angel there to guard you. You lived on my holy\\nmountain and walked among sparkling gems. Your conduct was perfect from the\\nday you were created until you began to do evil. You were busy buying and\\nselling, and this led you to violence and sin. So I forced you to leave my\\nholy mountain, and the angel who guarded you drove you away from the sparkling\\ngems. You were proud of being handsome, and your fame made you act like a\\nfool. Because of this I hurled you to the ground and left you as a warning to\\nother kings.Here, the Holy Spirit tells us how lucifer was decorated. Above\\nother Angels, in everything, he was decorated. Beauty, Wisdom, Splendor got\\ninto his head and here is what Pride made him do. How art thou fallen from\\nheaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground,\\nwhich didst weaken the nations!For thou hast said in thine heart, I will\\nascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit\\nalso upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:I will\\nascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.Yet thou\\nshalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.Isaiah:14: 10 -15When\\nhe fell this is how many Angels he took down with him. Revelation 12:4 With\\nhis tail he dragged a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to\\nthe earth. He stood in front of the woman, in order to eat her child as soon\\nas it was born.I don\\'t know what \"A third\" of the Stars (Angels) amounted to,\\nbut i know that that\\'s a huge number of Angels he took down with himNow, when\\nthey Fell, did Satan\\'s agenda of being God died? No. Now, remember, satan is\\nnot Omnipresence, meaning he can\\'t be everywhere at the same time, what do you\\nthink he did? He apportioned his demons to act as gods in all the religions of\\nworld. He possessed some humans and made them become very cruel to others.\\nPeople like, Muhammed of Arabia, Adolf Hitler, Mau SeTung, etc. Yes,\\nrulership, kingship, dominance is why satan fell from grace, but here man is,\\na naive creature with a kingdom, so satan deceived him by distracting him,\\nwhen man fell, he took over the kingdom God created for man and has been\\nruling man ever since.Remeber, even God can not operate and function in this\\nmaterial world without a material body, hence he possesses people by the (Holy\\nSpirit). Satan also being a spirit or his demons can not function in this\\nworld without a physical body, hence, evil possession. The body is like a\\ncloth that we wear. The spirits wear our bodies in other to walk in this\\nphysical world.Now, the activities of this Spirits, good or bad, makes them\\nwho or what they are. There\\'s just one Holy Spirit because he is Omnipresence.\\nThere are somany demons because they are not. They had to scather themselves\\neverywhere men are found, in order to subdue man under the dominance of\\nSatan.They possess men and make man do evil to make man responsible and sinful\\nbefore God, with the the sole aim of taking man to hellfire.Do you know why he\\ndoes that? Satan knows how much God loves man. Hurt man is hurt God deeply.\\nSo, he makes man turn against God. Satan knowing how the supernatural laws\\nwork, knows that, without willingness and responsibility, it\\'s not possible to\\nlay allegations agaisnt a man, So Satan makes man be willing and respinsible\\nfor his actions.So, yes, Fallen Angels, are demons. Witches are human beings\\npossessed by demons.And God created All.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Understanding Natural SelectionClarifying the Confusionby Dr. Georgia Purdom\\nand Dr. Nathaniel T. Jeanson on February 16, 2016; last featured May 7, 2018\\nForewordOn July 7, 2016, the Ark Encounter welcomed its first guests. What\\nmany do not realize is how much work and research goes on behind the scenes to\\nproduce the exhibits. One of the frequent questions we are asked is, “How do\\nwe get all the animals today from the animal kinds that were on the Ark?” One\\nof the ways is natural selection. Charles Darwin believed that natural\\nselection was the main mechanism behind molecules-to-man evolution. However,\\nas is clear from observational science, natural selection (along with other\\nmechanisms) only leads to variation within a kind and not the evolution of one\\nkind of animal into a completely different kind of animal. Because I highly\\nregard their integrity, commitment to biblical authority, and scientific\\npractice, I asked Dr. Georgia Purdom (PhD, Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State\\nUniversity) and Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson (PhD, Cell and Developmental Biology,\\nHarvard University) to write an article discussing the reality and role of\\nnatural selection. I endorse their conclusions and hope this will help answer,\\nin part, the question of how the many species of animals we have today\\ndescended from those kinds that were on the Ark.Ken Ham, president and CEO,\\nAnswers in GenesisOn the grassy plains of East Africa, a herd of Grant’s\\ngazelles meander slowly in the afternoon sun. Suddenly, the herd dashes off in\\nunison—with a streak of spotted fur in hot pursuit. The healthy gazelles\\neasily escape the hungry cheetah, but a sickly and weak gazelle at the back of\\nthe herd pitifully succumbs to the carnivore’s devices. Has “natural\\nselection” struck again? And why does it matter to the creation/evolution\\ndebate?Grant’s Gazelle (Nanger granti), Serengeti, Tanzania. Reproduced from\\nWikimedia Commons.The term natural selection has been defined clearly for over\\n150 years. Charles Darwin put the term in the title to his book On the Origin\\nof Species by Means of Natural Selection, and he articulated what he meant in\\nthe text of his seminal work:\"But if variations useful to any organic being do\\noccur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of\\nbeing preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of\\ninheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This\\nprinciple of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural\\nSelection.\"1Evolutionists to this day define it much the same way (but without\\nthe Victorian verbosity):\"The differential survival of and/or reproduction of\\nclasses of entities that differ in one or more characteristics.\"2Thus,\\n“survival of the fittest”3 or “survival of the fittest to reproduce” is the\\nstandard definition of the process termed natural selection, and it finds no\\nconflict with the text of Scripture.4 Ever since the fall (Genesis 3), living\\nthings have been dying and killing each other, and the self-evident fact of\\nnatural selection is perfectly consistent with the Bible. Natural selection\\nhas happened, and it continues to happen every day. In fact, the concept of\\nnatural selection was first articulated, not by an evolutionist, but by a\\ncreationist nearly a quarter century before Darwin published his most\\nsignificant work.5Furthermore, as biblical creationists, we must affirm that\\nthe term natural has been used from the earliest days of formal scientific\\ninquiry to describe God’s upholding of the universe through the laws of\\nnature. For the Christian, nature is simply shorthand for God’s providential\\noperation of the creatures and creation we see around us.6 In our example\\nabove, the culling of the sickly gazelle removes its unique genetic\\ncontribution from the overall genetic pool of the gazelle population,\\npotentially preventing propagation of its genetic mutations from spreading.In\\naddition, repetition of this predation cycle over time could alter the ratios\\nof genetic varieties in the gazelle species, potentially leading to the\\nformation of a new species. Thus, natural selection is an observable fact that\\ncan participate in the process of variation and speciation within the original\\nkinds of animals that God created.Unfortunately, evolutionists have taken a\\nstraightforward truth and co-opted it for their anti-biblical\\npurposes:\"[Natural selection] provided an entirely natural, mechanistic\\nexplanation for adaptive design that had been attributed to a divine\\nintelligence.\"7In the evolutionary worldview, natural selection and mutations\\nare the primary driving forces resulting in the evolution of all living things\\nfrom a single-celled common ancestor over billions of years—without any divine\\nintervention. In essence, atheistic evolutionists substitute natural selection\\nfor God Himself!The misuse of this term shouldn’t intimidate biblical\\ncreationists. After all, people have been co-opting terms for anti-biblical\\npurposes for millennia. Even today, unbelievers justify gay “marriage,”8\\nabortion,9 and all sorts of other sins in the name of “Christianity.” Yet no\\nBible-believer would logically conclude that, because sinners wrap the cloak\\nof “Christianity” around their vices, the entire Christian religion should be\\nthrown out. Instead, we would all agree that the abusers of the term should be\\nexposed, and the correct definition should be restored and emphasized to\\nprevent error from spreading.The same principle holds true in the realm of\\nnatural selection. Just because unbelievers co-opt the term for their anti-\\nChristian purposes doesn’t mean that natural selection isn’t real or that the\\nterm should be thrown out. Instead, biblical creationists should point out the\\nability of natural selection to remove the sickliest individuals from a\\npopulation and to preserve the least degenerate and most well-adapted\\norganisms,10 and we should also emphasize scientific inability of natural\\nselection to evolve the diversity of life from a common ancestor.11We should\\nalso expose the logical fallacies that evolutionists employ with natural\\nselection in an attempt to buttress their case. For example, when pressed for\\nevidence for molecules-to-man evolution, evolutionists often cite examples of\\nnatural selection. This is an equivocation fallacy since natural selection has\\nbeen deftly substituted for evolution mid-argument. These two terms have very\\ndifferent definitions.NATURAL SELECTION IS A FACT, BUT DARWINIAN EVOLUTION\\nFROM A UNIVERSAL COMMON ANCESTOR IS NOT.Furthermore, natural selection—the\\nsurvival of the fittest to reproduce—actually works in the opposite direction\\nof molecules-to-man evolution. Natural selection eliminates variety, and goo-\\nto-you evolution requires an ever-increasing growth in variety.12 Thus,\\nnatural selection is a fact, but Darwinian evolution from a universal common\\nancestor is not—despite the evolutionists’ best attempts to use the former to\\nprove the latter.Nevertheless, some biblical creationists have fallen into the\\nevolutionists’ equivocation trap and have attempted to refute evolution by\\nthrowing out the concept of natural selection entirely. On occasion, we are\\nasked what we think about such efforts. In short, while well intended, such\\nattempts end up being logically unsound, scientifically erroneous, and\\ntheologically deficient.At first pass, these arguments have an intrinsic\\nappeal. For example, Randy Guliuzza,13 a medical doctor and engineer by\\ntraining, has prominently appealed to design analogies to argue against the\\nexistence of natural selection and for a process that he terms “programmed\\nfilling.”14According to Guliuzza, in the human design process, it’s the\\nengineers who do all the work in trying to solve a problem, and the problem\\ncontributes nothing to the solution. Extrapolating this process to our gazelle\\nexample above, Guliuzza would argue that the gazelle represents the engineer,\\nand that the life-and-death attack by the cheetah represents the problem to be\\nsolved. Therefore, Guliuzza would argue that the survival of the gazelle\\ndepends entirely on the gazelle’s ability to “solve” this “problem” and has\\nnothing to do with the environment.In fact, Guliuzza takes his analogy so\\nliterally that he has denied any role whatsoever for the environment:\"Whether\\ncreatures live or die depends on their ability to generate information from\\ntheir DNA to produce specific traits that fit environments . . . diversity\\ndepends solely on variables inside the creature.\"15He even denies the\\nexistence of natural selection:\"natural selection—is a phantasm.\"16While\\nGuliuzza is well intentioned in his efforts to rebut evolution, his analogy\\nfails on several counts.17 First, creatures are not human engineers—by\\ndefinition. In our example, the gazelle cannot, by sheer will, change its DNA\\nto improve its metabolism, restructure its physiology, and grow longer legs to\\noutrun the cheetah. Furthermore, creatures reproduce, and engineers rarely\\nhave to solve problems with self-replicating devices. In our example, even if\\nthe gazelle could change its DNA, grow longer legs, and survive, how would\\nthat information be passed to its offspring? For that to happen, changes would\\nalso have to occur in the animal’s egg or sperm.Second, even if we loosen the\\nanalogy and make God the ultimate “engineer,” God is not a human engineer\\n(He’s much greater), and His creation and design acts encompass more than\\nanimals. He designed the environment as well, and He sovereignly rules it and\\neven summons it on occasion to perform His will (e.g., the flood, the Red Sea\\ncrossing, etc.). To say that a creature’s survival has nothing to do\\nwhatsoever with the environment is to rob God of His glory. It’s not the fault\\nof Pharaoh’s soldiers that they drowned. Their death is not a failure to\\nadapt, a failure to remember to wear buoyant armour, or a failure to excel in\\ntheir swimming lessons. Rather, God deliberately killed Pharaoh’s men with the\\nwaters of the Red Sea as an act of judgment on them and an act of salvation on\\nIsrael.In our example above, confusing causality also misses explicit\\nScriptural truths about the acts of God in history. Since the gazelles and the\\ncheetah are modern, post-Flood creatures, they exist in a world judged by God\\nat the fall (Genesis 3). As we all know, death and bloodshed are part of the\\ncurse under which we still live, and the purpose of the curse is an ongoing\\nreminder of the realities of sin, of God’s anger against sin, and of the need\\nfor salvation. To blame the death of the gazelle on a failure of the gazelle\\nto grow longer legs—rather than on the deliberate design of the cheetah to\\nkill (in a fallen world)—is to miss an important reminder of critical gospel\\ntruths.Third, it is well-documented observational science that certain aspects\\nof animal diversity—e.g., their genetics—depend on environmental variables.\\nTextbook observational science shows how UV light and radiation induces\\nspecific types of DNA damage. In fact, tests to measure environmentally\\ninduced DNA changes have existed since the 1970s.18 Changes to the DNA\\nsequence effectively result in increased genetic diversity.ASPECTS OF ANIMAL\\nDIVERSITY DO DEPEND ON MORE THAN VARIABLES INSIDE CREATURES.Environmental\\nvariables also participate in the expression of more visible traits. For\\nexample, in certain bird species, the action of sea water initiates the\\nexpression of a salt gland. Though the gland is encoded by the creature and\\nnot by the environment, the gland doesn’t become expressed until environmental\\nvariables (e.g., salt water) trigger its appearance.19 Clearly, aspects of\\nanimal diversity do depend on more than variables inside creatures.In short,\\nbiblically, Guliuzza’s claims deny that God sovereignly uses the environment\\nand the natural order to accomplish His work in the post-fall world in which\\nwe live. Scientifically, his claims are demonstrably false by virtue of prior\\nscientific findings that are both testable and repeatable.Thus, the process of\\nnatural selection—the survival of the fittest to reproduce—is a fact that\\nhighlights the providential care of God over a fallen creation and brings\\nglory to His power, judgment, and salvation. We embrace the proper use of this\\nterm, and we reject Randy Guliuzza’s erroneous claims about the nonexistence\\nof natural selection.Source\\n\\n',\n",

(Isaiah 19:19) ISAIAH: What land and people is this, Oh Sovereign?\\nGOD: Ah, to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of\\nEthiopia: … Go, ye swift messengers, to a people smooth-skinned, to a people\\nfeared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is\\ndivided by the rivers of whose land the rivers have spoiled! … At that time,\\nOfferings will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-\\nskinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange\\nspeech, whose land the rivers have spoiled. (Isaiah 18: 1,2,7) (FULFILMENT:\\nThe Map of Nigeria clearly indicates a land shadowing with wings occasioned by\\ntwo rivers, River Niger and River Benue which divides the country into two by\\na “wing-like” symbol as shown below: Please see below MAP OF NIGERIA: ‘A Land\\nShadowing with Wings’ Isaiah 18:1 The South Eastern part of the Country,\\nhabited by the Igbos and known as Land of Biafra and now defunct Biafran\\nState, Igboland, is a place whose land has the rivers have spoiled is evident\\nwith gullies and erosion, a major challenge of the people. Indeed, the people\\n(Ndigbo) are tall and smooth-skinned people feared (respected) far and wide,\\nvery aggressive in their pursuit for excellence, enterprise and breakthrough!\\nThey have been known to impact positively and bring about rapid development\\nwherever they sojourn. They control the markets and economy. Often they are\\nattacked by enemies who fear and jealous them for their economic prowess. They\\nare called the people of the “Land of the Rising Sun”. Indeed, Indeed, they\\nare feared). (Please see map description below) It is in this “Land of the\\nRising Sun – Biafra”, South East Nigeria, that in 1970, the LORD Almighty\\nestablished an Altar, in the heart of unseemly land, hidden and unexplored; a\\nplace called AWUDA NNOBI, Anambra State. And He raised a Pillar –Priest\\n(Isaiah 19:19), Micheal Nwobi Amakaeze (Ben Aaron I), who though even as a\\nyoung man, naïve and untutored in services of the Levitical Priesthood,\\noffered a burnt offering unto the LORD, on an Altar). ISAIAH: Ah Sovereign\\nLORD, and what shall be the sign when thou shall raise this Altar in the midst\\nof the Land of Egypt, among these people of strange semblance whom thou shall\\nmake to offer thee thy Food at the appointed time? GOD: See, have I not told\\nJeremiah saying, as long as there remains day and night: “David shall never\\nlack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel; nor shall the priests,\\nthe Levites, lack a man to offer burnt offerings before Me, to kindle grain\\nofferings, and to sacrifice continually” (Jeremiah 33:17), indeed, when I\\nshall cease to have my food from Jerusalem and shall raise for myself Priests\\nin that land beyond the rivers of Babylon; In that day [when] there will be an\\naltar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt… And it will be for a SIGN\\nand for a Witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will Cry\\nto the LORD because of the oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a\\nMighty One, and He will deliver them. Then the LORD will be known to Egypt,\\nand the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day, and will make Sacrifice and\\nOffering; yes, they will make a Vow to the LORD and perform it” (Isaiah\\n19:21). (FULFILMENT: In 1967, there was war in the ‘Land of the Rising’ – the\\nNigerian civil war also known as Biafra War. Shortly after a bloody coup -\\nKaduna Nzogwu 1967 Coup, the Igbos, the people of South East Nigeria became\\nthe target of humiliation, torture and death in the hands of their Nigerian\\nbrothers who severely oppressed them. Then, the LORD raised for them a\\nwarrior, savior and mighty one in the face of the oppression and massacre.\\nThere arose Odumegwu Ojukwu, a fine soldier and Lieutenant who rose to the cry\\nof his people. It was him who made them return home and declare the territory\\n“whose land the rivers have spoiled”; “the Sovereign State of Biafra – Land of\\nthe Rising Sun”. The secession disapproved by Nigeria who called them rebels,\\nand then the war broke out. For three years it raged. Slaughter! Harvest of\\nBlood! And the remnant of the Igbos cried the LORD; on January 1, 1970, in the\\nlittle village of Awuda Nnobi, among the Sabbatharian Sect (Sabbath/Seventh\\nDay Observers), in a fellowship, they gathered to make an Offering unto the\\nLORD: and the Spirit of the LORD selected for Himself a Priest among them,\\nMichael Amakaeze, who offered the burnt sacrifice that day (and became the\\nfirst African Levite and Priest). At the end of that offering/service, there\\nwas a prophecy, a word from the LORD Almighty, that by the sweet savour of\\nthat offering and the Altar, fourteen days from that faithful day, the LORD\\nwould bring the war to an end. Indeed, according to the Word of the LORD and\\nHis promise to the worshippers, the war came to a sudden end on 15th January,\\n1970, thereby fulfilling the word of the LORD by the mouth of His Servant\\nIsaiah. And that day, the Order of the Levitical Service and Priesthood was\\nestablished among them to this day. Since then till date, there has not ceased\\nto be a burnt offering sacrifice offered unto the LORD at the appointed times\\nand festivals as contained in Numbers 28. And the people began to build unto\\nthe LORD, a Sanctuary/High Tabernacle which dedicated on Tishri 15, 5771\\n(September 22, 2010) in that village, even as the people prepare to celebrate\\nits golden jubilee and fifty years anniversary) ISAIAH: O LORD, you are my\\nGod; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you\\nhave done marvelous things, things planned long ago (Isaiah 25:1).\\nSUMMARYIndeed, since the erecting of the Altar and the establishment of the\\nOrder, over these years, according to the Word of the LORD, the Worship of\\nYHWH – Blessed Be His Name, and the doctrine of the Ancient Path, with the\\nServices of the Levitical Priesthood enshrined therein in the Statutes and\\nOrdinances of the Sovereign , has spread in the Continent of Africa from\\nNigeria, especially to Cameroun, Gabon, South Africa and most recently Ghana.\\nThis fulfils the verse that in that day, five cities (Countries) in Egypt\\n(Africa) would speak the language of Canaan (Hebrew) and swear allegiance to\\nthe LORD Almighty (Isaiah 19:18): indeed, they now use the Hebrew language in\\ntheir services/worship and sing the SHEMA YISREAL! On the other hand,\\naccording to the word of the LORD, Temple service has ceased in Jerusalem\\nsince its destruction by the Roman soldiers and exile of the people. This is\\nto fulfil the Word of the LORD saying:“For the children of Israel shall abide\\nmany days without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, without\\nephod or teraphim. Afterward the children of Israel shall return and seek the\\nLORD their God and David their king. They shall fear the LORD and His goodness\\nin the latter days.” (Hosea 3:4) And to His Prophet Zephaniah saying:“Then I\\nwill purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them call on the name of the\\nLORD and serve Him shoulder to shoulder. From beyond the rivers of Babylon, my\\nworshippers, my scattered people will bring me offerings. On that day, you\\n(Israel) will be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done me (Zephaniah\\n3:9,10). And it is also being fulfilled, that which He spoke by the mouth of\\nHis servant Malachi in the face of the abuse of the Temple and the services\\nthereof by the people and priests alike, saying:“‘Oh, that one of you would\\nshut the Temple doors, So that you would not kindle fire on My altar in vain!\\nI have no pleasure in you’, Says the LORD of hosts, ‘Nor will I accept an\\noffering from your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even to its going\\ndown, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; In every place incense shall\\nbe offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among\\nthe nations’, Says the LORD of hosts.” Indeed, the name of the LORD is great\\namong the gentiles, where He has manifested Himself, and in many places, in\\nNigeria, especially Anambra, Imo & Lagos, incense is being offered unto the\\nLORD, a pure offering and whole burnt offering offered at the appointed times\\nand festivals of Sabbaths, Newmoons, Passover, Pentecost, Trumpet, Atonement\\nand Tabernacles. FINAL WORDSFinally, in the face of the fulfillment of these\\nscriptural prophecies, as is evident before our very eyes, it calls for sober\\nreflection, especially in this “Ten Days of Awe” and Yom Kippur; to take heed\\nto our covenant with God Almighty, to walk in all His ways and commandment and\\nrejoice in His blessings, lest, by reason of the multitude of transgression\\nand abuse of His grace and abounding mercies, we lose the very things we\\ntreasure to others.

              "  'response': \"Time to resurrect this thread!!Everyone here can understand that the person\\nwhom you talk about is mazi Nnamdi Kanu. God has raised him out of the rubbles\\nof the contraption called Nigeria to re-awaken the minds of people and bring\\nthem back to himself. That which is happening today has been written long ago.\\nJust as major Prophets of old, they are not the most perfect beings and are\\nantagonised by their own people but God speaks to his people through them and\\nhis words always come to pass. They speak with authority and are always\\ncritical of evil leaders in the land, nobody can be able to harm them until\\nthey achieve the mission of which they were sent.If Jesus Christ was in our\\ntime of today i'm very sure he'd get the same (if not worse) treatment from\\nhumans because he would still condemn the Pharisees as he did before, he'd\\nstill condemn the rulers of the land as he did before, he would still speak\\nwith great authority as he did before, and nobody would dare lay a finger to\\nharm him until his time comes (just as it was written in the Bible).As it was\\nin the time of Noah, the judges, the kings, the prophets, the time of Jesus\\nChrist, the apostles so it is now. God never changes, and the heart of man has\\nremained wicked ever since he was casted away from the garden.We all visualise\\nthe modern day prophets sent by God to be white men that 'roll' with the high\\nand mighty in the society, the pastors, popes the high and mighty e.t.c but it\\nhas never been that way and will never be. God raises the lowly and uses them\\nto do great things.You see.... just as the pharisees, levites, Sadducees,\\nscribes and custodians of the law (who felt that they could tell God what to\\ndo and who to choose) were very envious and jealous of Christ (a mere\\nuneducated carpenter's son from the insignificant city of Bethlehem in\\ngalilee) and planned to put him to death, just as the prophets were all put\\ninto prison at some point and persecuted as well so it is now. You cannot be a\\nfollower of Elohim, the creator of the universe and expect not to be\\npersecuted by the evil men of this earth.Since the times of Enoch the anointed\\none of YHWH, when semjaza, azazel and other watchers rebelled against Elohim\\nand corrupted the earth with all sorts of evil, dark evil has reigned in the\\nworld. But God has constantly sent messengers to call back his people to\\nhimself and walk in his light. People like Elijah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist,\\nElisha, Isaiah, Daniel e.t.c were normal humans with extraordinary spiritual\\ngraces and anointing from Elohim they speak and it happens as it has been\\nsaid.Be very critical of what you say and do. Just as we criticise the\\nIsraelites of old as being blind and unwise in their dispositions so are the\\npeople of today. If one writes the events of these days and documents it just\\nas it was done in the Torah and bible then you will see that we are far worse\\noff than they are. We have eyes but cannot see, ears but cannot hear, we claim\\nto be holy and religious but do not know God, and he has seen how darkened our\\nhearts are and have shut our evil minds from discerning his revelations and\\nknowing the truth because we really do not want to know the truth.Nnamdi Kanu\\nis another prophet, he speaks with great authority, he is very critical of our\\nevil rulers of today and when he prophesies what he has been told by Elohim,\\nit always comes to pass. But since we are evil just as our fathers of old, we\\nhave persecuted him and tried to put him to death severally but nothing can be\\ndone and will be done to him until be fulfills the mission which Elohim has\\nsent him to do.History always repeats itself, we are no different than the\\nPharisees, the Sadducees, the evil kings of old who kill and persecute the\\nprophets sent by YHWH to his people. But i warn you, beware of the things you\\nsay and do...for a great event is coming and when it comes you will know that\\nno one can dare question the ways of Elohim, the creator of the world.\\n\\n\",\n",

Then I\\ntold him I felt Tola was in some form of danger and that he should please try\\nto at least call him. I had not also contacted Tola in a while but my spirit\\njust told me something was not right with him.Fast forward to this morning,\\naround 6 am after my devotion. I received messages on my WhatsApp from Tola.\\nThe message read: “Pastor, please help me. I need both prayer and financial\\nassistance. My wife is in the state hospital. I was told to deposit 215k to\\nhave them commence operation on her. She has been in labor since day before\\nyesterday. I only can gather 120k. Plz. I don’t know what to do\\nPastor.”Immediately I swung into action. I requested for his account details\\nand sent him some cash, then I told him to relax, that his wife was going to\\nhave a safe delivery. I also gave him Isaiah 8:18 and told him to start\\nreading it aloud and claiming it for himself and his wife.He thanked me and\\ntold me he was on his way home to see if he could sell some of his properties\\nto raise the remaining funds.About one hour afterwards he called me and was\\nweeping very profusely. I tried to calm him down but he seemed inconsolable.He\\nthen broke the news to me that they just called him from the hospital to tell\\nhim that his wife was dead! He kept on saying, “I lost her, she is dead...”\\nThen he continued crying profusely.Immediately, I told him to stop crying,\\nthat his wife cannot die like that except he accepts the news. As I was\\ntalking he cut the call out of hysteria. I tried severally to call him back\\nbut he didn’t pick my calls.I quickly went on WhatsApp and sent him this\\nmessage: “Hello bro. Pick my calls! This is not the first time a person\\npronounced dead will come back to life by the power of the anointing of God,\\nbro. Get a bottle of anointing oil. Go to where your wife is, put it into her\\nmouth and anoint her head with it, then read Isaiah 8:18 aloud on her head.\\nWhen you buy the oil let me know so I can bless it.

I will do it now.” He got the anointing\\noil, I blessed it and told him to continue reading Isaiah 8:18 aloud as he\\njourneyed to where his wife is. I told him to slot his wife’s name into the\\nscriptures, that her spirit will hear his voice and she will jerk back to\\nlife. Hallelujah. Glory to Jesus!

The sinner cannot dodge it; you work and you must get paid. Ezekiel\\n18:20 says:“The soul that sinneth, it shall die.

You may be a dedicated church goer BUT NOT A CHRISTIAN WHO IS ON\\nFIRE FOR GOD..... So drop your imagination and accept the fact that you both\\nare FREETHINKERS..... then prepare to get married without consent and start\\nyour own generation its simple. If she is strong in Islam, she would believe\\nislam is the ONLY WAY to Allah AND if she truly loves you, she would bring you\\ninto her way.... IF YOU WERE EVER IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HOLY\\nSPIRIT then you would have been convicted many times to preach to her and get\\nher saved.

There is no Scriptural authority for that. God Himself\\npronounces you married once your parents consent to your union! This is how\\nGod defines marriage-“a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to\\nhis wife, and they shall become one”-Genesis 2:24. I have read Scripture from\\ncover to cover in multiple languages. Scripture has no instance of a wedding\\nbeing done in a church, temple, or synagogue. Isaac married at home (Gen\\n24:67). Christ attended a wedding at a HOME (John 2:2-10). Isaiah was a\\nprophet. When he wanted to marry a fellow prophetess, all he did was invite 2\\nwitnesses. And immediately the woman moved into his home (Isaiah 8:2-3). No\\nceremony at all. Are you holier than Isaiah? Hosea’s marriage was captured in\\nonly 1 verse-Hosea 1:3. God made marriage EASY. It is humans who made it\\ncomplicated. Church has no business with weddingThe ONLY people involved are *\\nA man* A woman* ParentsNo pastor or church is involved!

Furthermore,terrorism\\nor killing of innocent souls is not anyway part of teachings of Islam with not\\njust an evidence but evidences from Glorious Qur'an warning muslims from\\nkilling or fighting innocent souls and even going to state the punishment for\\ndoing so. Allah(S.W.T) said in the Holy Qur'an chapter 5:v32(For that cause,We\\ndecreed for the children of Israel that whoever killeth a human being for\\nother than manslaughter or corruption,it shall be as if he had killed all\\nmankind,and whoso saveth the life of one,it shall be as if he had saved the\\nlife of all mankind).

It is His personal pursuit to right wrong things.GOD is righteous\\nand HE will judge us according to his righteous standard.The Scripture says in\\nRomans 2:5-6;\"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto\\nthyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous\\njudgment of God;Who will render to every man according to his deeds:\"No doubt,\\nour GOD is Righteous and Merciful...Except in one place His goodness won\\'t be\\nshown;Hell Fire!He will not be \"merciful\"when you die in sin.Because through\\nHIS MERCY we are given the time and chance to repent after which comes\\nJUDGMENT.Don\\'t allow yourself to be caught unaware.And don\\'t dance to the tune\\nof those satanic statements which mesmerized your mind with;\"How can a Loving\\nand merciful God send His beautiful creatures (Humans) to a fiery furnace\\n(Hell)?\"It is a Diabolical Lie from the pit of Hell!Don\\'t adhere to that.Lest\\nyou forget:As the Pic Caption rightly says, out of more than 600,000 men who\\nleft with Moses from Egypt, only two (Joshua & Caleb) were \\'saved\\' to enter\\nThe Promised Land.The entire Sodom & Gomorrah was destroyed with fiery-\\nbrimstones, only three persons (Lot & his two Daughters,...the wife turned to\\npillar of salt) were Saved.He destroyed the entire world with water (Flood),\\nwith only eight persons (Noah & his wife, his three Sons & their wives) being\\nkept alive.Even those angels (The Fallen One) who misbehaved and followed\\nLucifer plot, weren\\'t left undone...for which He sent down one-third of them-\\nall...awaiting fiery indignation.Do you think He will spare you too if you\\ndon\\'t Repent?The Word says in 2 Peter 2:5-7;\"And spared not the old world, but\\nsaved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the\\nflood upon the world of the ungodly;And turning the cities of Sodom and\\nGomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample\\nunto those that after should live ungodly;And delivered just Lot, vexed with\\nthe filthy conversation of the wicked:\"WAKE UP AND REPENT OF ALL\\nUNRIGHTEOUSNESS.Now is the appointed time...Tomorrow may be Too Late!And to\\nthose with the ideology of \"Once Saved Always saved(OSAS)\", it\\'s an ignorant\\nthought from the Pit of Hell!!Never you presume your salvation; but work it\\nout with FEAR and Trembling.The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the\\nnations that forget God.-Psalms 9:17But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the\\nabominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and\\nall liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and\\nbrimstone: which is the second death.-Revelation 21:8GOD\\'S judgment makes sure\\neverything in the end conforms to His holy standard.There are no exceptions.\\nBecause of this reason, each of us should carefully comply to all of God\\'s\\nexpectations.Hear This in 2 Chronicles 34:21\"Go, enquire of the LORD for me,\\nand for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the\\nbook that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon\\nus, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all\\nthat is written in this book.\"\"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of\\nthe living GOD\" -Hebrews 10:31REPENT AS THE WILL BE NO MERCY AFTER DEATH.NOW\\nIS THE APPOINTED\\nTIME!.https://free.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2627317737542408&id;=1718972725043585&refid;=17&ref;=opera_speed_dial_freefb&_ft_=mf_story_key.2627317737542408%3Atop_level_post_id.2627317737542408%3Atl_objid.2627317737542408%3Acontent_owner_id_new.1718972725043585%3Athrowback_story_fbid.2627317737542408%3Apage_id.1718972725043585%3Aphoto_id.2627317704209078%3Astory_location.4%3Astory_attachment_style.photo%3Atds_flgs.3%3Apage_insights.%7B%221718972725043585%22%3A%7B%22page_id%22%3A1718972725043585%2C%22page_id_type%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22actor_id%22%3A1718972725043585%2C%22dm%22%3A%7B%22isShare%22%3A0%2C%22originalPostOwnerID%22%3A0%7D%2C%22psn%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22post_context%22%3A%7B%22object_fbtype%22%3A266%2C%22publish_time%22%3A1593343280%2C%22story_name%22%3A%22EntStatusCreationStory%22%2C%22story_fbid%22%3A%5B2627317737542408%5D%7D%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22sl%22%3A4%2C%22targets%22%3A%5B%7B%22actor_id%22%3A1718972725043585%2C%22page_id%22%3A1718972725043585%2C%22post_id%22%3A2627317737542408%2C%22role%22%3A1%2C%22share_id%22%3A0%7D%5D%7D%7D%3Athid.1718972725043585%3A306061129499414%3A2%3A0%3A1596265199%3A-1913544392545257930&__tn__=%2As-R\\n\\n',\n",

These forces are responsible for the evil we see\\nin the world today. The devil does not operate alone, he operates with the\\nhelp of his demonic agents, such as witches and wizards, voodoo priests,\\nnecromancers, soothsayers, stargazers, palm readers, tarrot card players,\\ndiviners,mediums, psychics, etc. All this people are agents of the devil used\\nto manipulate and harm naive people including Christians. My dear friend, do\\nnot be deceived, demonic forces are real, and if you are not protected, you\\ncan be a victim of the devil. But I am not here to put fear in you today,\\nrather I am here to expose you to the power that can silent all the powers of\\ndarkness. The power of prayer. Today we are going to be looking at prayer for\\nprotection from black magic and witchcraft powers.Every child of God that is\\ngiven to prayers cannot be a victim of spells and enchantment, your prayer\\nlife makes you to hot for the devil to tamper with. Even demons recognize\\nChristians that are on fire for God. When your prayer life is active, you are\\non fire for God. The devil is constantly stealing ,killing and destroying\\nlives on a daily basis, every evil we see in the world today has its root in\\nthe demonic world, the terrorists attacks, the violence in our schools, the\\ncrimes on our streets etc this are all manipulations of demonic powers, aiming\\nto kill and take as many souls to hell as possible. We must pray this prayer\\nfor protection against this evil forces and evil arrows. We must pray for our\\nown protection on a daily basis,because when God is with you, no devil can be\\nagainst you, God will always protect you like He protected the children of\\nisreal in the wilderness. He will be a wall of fire round about you, making it\\nimpossible for any devil to afflict you. Even when the agents of darkness come\\nagainst you, they will all be destroyed in a heart beat. That is what you\\nexperience when you are a prayerful Christian. I encourage you to pray this\\nprayers in faith and pray them always, they may be long but, they are\\npowerful. You can break them down in smaller groups and pray it intensively\\nand see the Lords hands continually on your life in jesus name.Praise and\\nworshipPRAYER POINT1.

              "  'content': 'The preaching of the coming kingdom of God on earth and the name of Jesus\\nChrist made up all that one needs to know before he or she is baptized. We see\\nthis in Acts 8:12. It is remarkable to note that all the Bible passages speak\\nof the same kingdom of God and no one contradicted the other.We shall look at\\nPaul’s teaching of the kingdom in 1 Corinthians 15. In this chapter, Paul\\nbegan by giving a summary of the gospel that he preached. He went on to\\nnarrate an apocalyptic discussion on the kingdom to come and how it will be\\nestablished here on earth by our Lord Jesus Christ.1 Corinthians 15: 22For as\\nin Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. 23But each in turn:\\nChrist, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. 24Then\\nthe end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he\\nhas destroyed all dominion, authority and power. 25For he must reign until he\\nhas put all his enemies under his feet. 26The last enemy to be destroyed is\\ndeath. 27For he “has put everything under his feet.” c Now when it says that\\n“everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include\\nGod himself, who put everything under Christ. 28When he has done this, then\\nthe Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so\\nthat God may be all in all.Here Paul explains to us how the kingdom of God\\nwill be established on earth. It will come in this order: VS 23 Resurrection\\nof the saints and judgement. After the judgement of the saints, Jesus will\\nimmortalize the righteous servants. See 1Cor 15: 21,22.Also hear the words of\\nour lord:Mat 25:32-40 NET 32 All the nations will be assembled before him, and\\nhe will separate people one from another like a shepherd separates the sheep\\nfrom the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his\\nleft. 34 Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are\\nblessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation\\nof the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you\\ngave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I was\\nnaked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you took care of me, I was in\\nprison and you visited me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when\\ndid we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to\\ndrink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or naked and\\nclothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ 40 And\\nthe king will answer them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did it for one\\nof the least of these brothers or sisters of mine, you did it for me.’2 VS\\n24-25 Jesus will establish God’s kingdom on earth and together with the\\nimmortalized saints reign for a period of time. Jesus revealed later that this\\nperiod is ‘1,000’ years.See: Rev 20:6 NET Blessed and holy is the one who\\ntakes part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them,\\nbut they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him\\nfor a thousand years.3 VS 26: During this time, there will still be mortals.\\nBut Jesus will eventually destroy death forever. Isaiah told us that people\\nwill live for a very long time during this period. Infact anyone who dies at\\n100 years of age just died like a child!See: Isa 65:19-21 NET 19 “Jerusalem\\nwill bring me joy, and my people will bring me happiness. The sound of weeping\\nor cries of sorrow will never be heard in her again. 20 Never again will one\\nof her infants live just a few days or an old man die before his time. Indeed,\\nno one will die before the age of a hundred, anyone who fails to reach the age\\nof a hundred will be considered cursed. 21 They will build houses and live in\\nthem; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.”4 VS 27-28: After this\\n1,000 year reign of Jesus Christ the king of kings, Jesus will handover the\\ngovernment and power to Almighty God his father.Read this verse again to see\\nthat the notion of Trinity is wrong. Jesus is not the Almighty God but he is\\nsubject to God. After this reign of Christ, Jesus, the saints and everyone\\nwill now be under the direct divine rule of God forever. So that God will be\\nall in all! Hallelujah!God have revealed his wondrous plan to us mere mortals.\\nHe even ask us to be okay or this by believing, getting baptised into Jesus\\nand following his precepts. Even if we die, when Jesus come again, he will\\nbring us back to life again and give us immortality and we will reign with him\\non earth.Rev 5:9-10“9 They sang a new song, saying, “You are worthy to take\\nthe book and to open its seals: for you were killed, and bought us for God\\nwith your blood out of every tribe, language, people, and nation, 10 and made\\nus kings and priests to our God, and we will reign on the\\nearth.”https://www.preachi.com/basic-bible-teachings/how-gods-kingdom-will-be-\\nestablished-by-jesus-christ-according-to-paul/\\n\\n',\n",

(2).”Basic\\nScripture: Song of Solomon 2:1-10Song 2:1 says: “I am the rose of Sharon, and\\nthe lily of the valleys.” Note the word VALLEYS” and not just one valley!\\nThere can be many phases in your life called VALLEYS! They are times of\\ndepression, betrayals, disappointments, delays, etc. At such times, the LORD\\nis saying “DON’T WORRY! I will BEAUTIFY your VALLEY and restore you to the\\nmountaintop!” Always pray: Thou LILY of the VALLEY; beautify my dirty valley!\\nThou LILY of the VALLEY decorate and re-design the VALLEY SEASON of my\\nlife/ministry. Yes! You will not die in your VALLEY! You will pass through!\\nSee Psalm 23:4.When you let go of what you are, you become what you want to\\nbe! That’s why I like the phrase “HAKUNA MATATA” – It’s a Swahili phrase\\nmeaning, “DON’T WORRY”, popularized of course by the 1994 Disney movie, “The\\nLion King.” Stop that worry! Wake up every morning and shout to yourself\\nHAKUNA MATATA! Call your name and say: “No worries today!

It says that despite\\nyour problems, challenges, delays you don’t have to worry because one way or\\nthe other, God Will Make a Way for you, where there seems to be no way. So be\\nbrave and courageous! I hear the sound of abundance of Testimonies if you\\nrefuse to worry! Hold on! Hold out and trust your God!

If the woman concerned is pregnant one may not have\\nsexual relations with her until after the birth of her child.(3) It is not\\nnecessary for female captives of war to be People of the Book in order that\\nsexual relations with them be permitted.

So relax I was just as confused as you are until I knew what am about\\nto tell you. But first, let me explain the origin of sin. How did sin and\\ndeath come into the world today?You would agree with me that sin and death\\nweren’t in the world then, as it is today. Let me tell you what happened then.\\nIn the past, when God created Adam and Eve, he placed them both in a beautiful\\ngarden. God’s aim was that man would represent or rather become an extension\\nof his kingdom here on earth. However, that motive was truncated the moment\\nbrother Adam and sister Ever are the forbidden fruit that God instructed Adam\\nnot to eat! And so, as a result of this, this couple lost;*Their sense of\\ndominion.*Lost the ability to hear clearly from God.*Lost their place in the\\ngarden.And through them, sin and death walked boldly into the world. Ever\\nsince God knew he had to work out a plan that will lead mankind back to him\\nand that was what led to the Redemptive plan in which our Lord Jesus Christ,\\nthe son of God was crucified on the cross of Calvary and through him, he\\nbrought grace and life in abundance back to man so that you and I can now\\nstand before the God through the blood of Jesus Christ.However, I want you to\\nunderstand that we are sinners because through Adam we sinned.

But then, what\\'s\\nthe essence of a seal upon an empty document. It\\'s nothing but a waste of\\ninvestment.�For today, we will be considering 2 Bible characters which portray\\nthe seal of God upon an individual and what an empty content\\nmeans.PHARISEE�They had the law written upon tables and on scrolls, but they\\ndidn\\'t allow God to write the law in their hearts. No wander they remained\\nsinners. \"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against\\nthee.\" Psalms 119:11�They were resting on the external privileges of the\\nblessings of Abraham, but not the eternal faith of Abraham unto salvation.\\n\"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say\\nwithin yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God\\nis able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\" Luke 3:8�They were\\nresting on the external privileges of the blessings of Abraham, but not the\\neternal faith of Abraham unto salvation. \"Bring forth therefore fruits worthy\\nof repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our\\nfather: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up\\nchildren unto Abraham.\" Luke 3:8�They instructed the foolish without\\nacknowledging their own folly. \"Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching\\nfor doctrines the commandments of men. For laying aside the commandment of\\nGod, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many\\nother such like things ye do.(such as ablution) And he said unto them, Full\\nwell ye reject the commandment of God (faith in Christ and repentance unto\\ngodliness) that ye may keep your own tradition. Mark 7:7-9�They had the\\nspecial presence of God in the temple made by hands, yet they didn\\'t allow God\\nto dwell in their temple made without hand (their body which is the temple of\\nthe Holy Ghost). \"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye,\\nbeing rooted and grounded in love. May be able to comprehend with all saints\\nwhat is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love\\nof Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the\\nfulness of God. Ephesians 3:15-19. Even as the glory of God filled the\\nphysical temple.�They had a form of Godliness but denied the power thereof.\\nSuch as, in dressing and church attendance, but the real transformation of the\\nheart and regeneration of the spirit are missing. �They were religious but not\\nrightousness. Righteousness comes by faith in Christ.�They knew Jesus came\\nfrom God, yet they persecuted Him�They supposed to show their people the way\\nto God, yet they rejected God’s own Gift to the world willfully.Lessons��The\\nbest knowledge can produce is a form of godliness. Remember, it can\\'t produce\\nthe power. ��The best you can be, by being sanctimonious, is to be religious\\nbut not righteous. �� External observances without internal piety are as\\nnothing. Religion without righteousness is vain. Eternal cleaniness without\\ninward cleansing amounts to nothing.��Circumcision is nothing, and\\nuncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. 1\\nCorinthians 7:19��You can be eloquent in speech, and skilled in the\\ncontroversy of religion, remember, it\\'s he Holy Spirit that brings\\nconviction.��You can win an argument, and clear people\\'s doubt but it\\'s Holy\\nSpirit that convicts. Head knowledge is unfruitful if it doesn\\'t bring you to\\nrepentance and refreshing in prayers.SAMSON�Samson had the anointing, yet he\\nwas a fornicator and hardly escaped the danger of an harlot.�Samson was a man\\nof strength. However, he was robbed of his strength by his own lust.�Samson\\nwas a great man, yet he was betrayed into the hand of his sworned\\nenemies.�Samson was a worrior, yet he was consumed in his own lust and became\\nan object of mockery.�Samson was a promised child, but he terminated his own\\nministry on the lap of Delilah.�Samson was born by the Will of God, but he\\ndidn\\'t do the will of God in marriage nor in lifestyle.�Samson was a covenant\\nchild, yet he didn\\'t make covenant with his own eyes like Job did.�Samson was\\nfilled with power, yet he fell into the love of women and lusted after\\nthem.�Samson was elected of God right from his mother\\'s womb, but he was a\\nlair. He was mighty on the outside but feeble on the inside.�Samson was a man\\nof influence but he indulged his sensual appetites in unceaniness and\\nfleshly.Lessons��Anointing is not necessary a sign of spiritual power.\\nSpiritual power is the ability to put your body under subjection and to be\\nmaster your own body. Spiritual power is having dominion over temptations and\\ntempters, seductions and seducers, sins and self, trials and\\ntemperaments.��The anointed does not fall because of anointing but weakness of\\nhis human spirit. We can always get anointing while a strong spirit is not a\\ngift. However, a strong spirit is built over time, with delebrate effort of\\neating the word and refreshing in the place of prayer.\\uf449\\uf3fb For the fact that you\\ncan perform signs and wonders does not guarantee the presence of God in you.\\nAfter all, Samson carried the gate of the city on his shoulder even after\\nspending night with an harlot.��Anointing is just a seal, but you in which the\\nseal is laid upon is the most important. You have have the right spirit within\\nyou as well. It is possible to still speak in tongues even when the Holy\\nSpirit has departed. ��Being a miracle worker is not a license for heaven.\\nAfter all, Lucifer has lost heaven, yet his power as in the beginning still\\nremains with him , God chose not to take it back. Thereby he performs lieing\\nwonders, yet that doesn\\'t make him qualified for heaven.��External\\nmanifestations of power is not equivalent to inward purity.��Anointing without\\nholiness is like a vehicle of power with no engine.��Power without purity is\\nlike a well without water and cloud without rain.I pray God will grant all of\\nus the wisdom not to abandon the weightier matter, and be filled with the\\nright spirit within, unto holiness and righteousness.

              "  'content': 'The newly elected president of Malawi, Lazarus Mccarthy Chakwera has revealed\\nhow his personal experience with God redirected his life towards becoming not\\njust a minister but the president of the country.The president who just\\nassumed office on 28 June 2020 made this known in a video posted June 30 on\\nFacebook monitored by Scooper News. He also affirmed that his life was a\\nresult of God’s grace.He said “you know I look at my life and all that I’ve\\nbecome as a result of God’s Grace. I was born with some kind of impediment, I\\ncouldn’t talk to people, you know if there were 3 or 5 people I just shut\\ndown.“I wasn’t able to communicate but God changed my whole life and future\\nafter I met him personally and he redirected my life towards the ministry. I\\nhave seen God’s grace, I have preached to 5, 50, and more than 50,000 people.\\nIt has just taken God’s grace. There is no way I could have ever dreamt that\\nwas gonna be possible”.Lazarus who had been a theologian and leader of the\\nMalawi Assemblies of God disclosed that he had to argue with God over the\\ndirection in life as running for president didn’t seem natural to Him and was\\na struggle.He explained further that he had to talk to God a lot, read the\\nscriptures until God spoke to his heart on a particular day.“God was not\\nsaying I’m pulling you out of ministry, God was saying I am extending your\\nministry so that you are able to pastor a whole nation,” he said.He said God\\nwas choosing him for a purpose, whilst saying that God also chose Israel to be\\na nation that would be an example of a relationship with God and his\\npeople.“God was saying, I want you to get in and get involved,” he said.He\\nthen emphasized that he only got to this position as a result of God’s grace\\nand that he would never have become the president if God hasn’t chosen him.“It\\nhas been another point of grace in my life because I never dreamt for a day\\nthat I would be running for public office after I’ve been in ministry all my\\nlife. So to me really, grace is spelt, Jesus.Grace is what the Lord has done\\nand taken and considering a person like myself becoming a part of His family.\\nI cannot claim or lay claim on any good thing that I did to bring me this\\nfavour. That is grace to me because I understand that I wouldn’t be where I am\\nor who I am if it hadn’t been for Jesus. So grace Is Jesus” he\\nsaid.https://www.mcebiscoo.com/shocking-i-never-dreamt-i-would-be-president-\\nafter-being-a-pastor-all-my-life-newly-elected-malawi-president-confesses/\\n\\n',\n",

He has obviously gotten himself into big trouble! His ambitions,\\ndreams, goals, etc are all gone, because he failed to embrace God's\\ninjunctions that concerns purity. I'm sure the young man right now will be\\nregretting not adhering to the messages of the gospel; and will wish he can\\nturn back the hands of time to start living a life of complete purity and\\nchastity. It's a pity! Listen to me, lack of self control will ALWAYS lead\\npeople into trouble. It's surprising when I see young people today telling\\nthemselves that they can't control their urges and desires (and they can't but\\nindulge in premarital sex, adultery, masturbation, porn, and other dirty\\nthings) I'm also a young person like you.. I'm just in my twenties.. And I've\\nnever had sex before! Guess what? I'm hale and healthy! I have urges like\\nevery other young person, but I will never be a slave to my urges, nor allow\\nmy body push me into acts that will ruin my life and destiny. You must have\\nfull control over yourself! If you can't control your urges, irrespective of\\nwhere you are currently in life (and what you have achieved), you can get\\nruined in the twinkling of an eye! At the height of sexual emotions and\\nfeelings, your body will be so keen on immediate gratification, common sense\\nwill fly away, and you won't mind doing something wrong just for the temporary\\npleasure. That's what happened to that young man! It can be you too! If you\\ndon't learn self control and choose to honour God with your body by living a\\nlife of complete purity and chastity, you will soon find yourself in a\\nregrettable position like that young man. You can become a rapist (it's after\\nthe act that you will come back to your senses)! You can pick a sexual virus\\nthat will ruin your body! You can destroy your womb and cut off your life\\nprematurely when you attempt abortion! Many young people have destroyed\\nthemselves because they have chosen to live contrary to the Will of God! God's\\nWill is that we have dominion over everything (including our sexual urges and\\ndesires), and we should not be slaves to our bodies, sin and satan. You can\\nlive a life of complete purity and chastity if you will cooperate with the\\nSpirit of God. Just embrace Jesus Christ, and keep asking Him everyday for\\nGrace and strength to live according to His Precepts. Avoid persons, things\\nand places that will lure you into sexual immorality.. Discover your purpose\\nin God. Get busy and occupied. And you will always be fine! God bless you.\\n\\n\",\n",

SCRIPTURE: And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine\\nhand? And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it\\non the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. Exodus\\n4:2-3.THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: When you come to the end of yourself, you are at\\nthe beginning with God.Previously, we saw that coming to the end of oneself is\\nkey to experiencing a new beginning with God. For instance, it was when Adam\\ncame to the end of himself by agreeing to sleep that God made Eve for him\\n(Gen. 3:21-22).Now, it is important to understand that apart from Adam,\\nexamples abound in Scriptures of people who came to the end of themselves, and\\nexperienced new beginnings with God. Moses was one of such people. He came to\\nthe end of himself and saw God mightily at work in his life. But forty years\\nbefore this time, Moses had tried to do the work of God in the energy of the\\nflesh by killing an Egyptian who fought against his fellow Israelite. He then\\nran away from Pharaoh who wanted to kill him for killing the Egyptian (Exodus\\n2:11-15). Moses was on the run from his life’s assignment for forty years.\\nWhen he returned to God through the Burning Bush Encounter (Exodus 3:1-3), God\\ntold him, “Before I can do anything with you, you must pull your shoes” (Exo.\\n3:5 paraphrased). The pulling of the shoe was a sign of surrender. To pull\\nyour shoes means to surrender your motion, direction and steps to God. Another\\nway Moses surrendered himself to God was the dropping of his rod on the ground\\n(Exodus 4:2-3). God asked him to drop the rod he used in tending the flock for\\nforty years and he did. That rod signified his business tool or power. God\\nseemed to tell Moses, “For forty years, this rod has been in your hand but it\\nhas produced nothing. Surrender it to me and see what it will produce.” And he\\ndropped it. But when he picked it up again, it was no longer an ordinary rod;\\nit has become a tool of vengeance, a judgemental instrument that parted the\\nRed Sea, buried Pharaoh and sank his entire army. Imagine that! For forty\\nyears, the same rod was useless in Moses’ hand but when he handed it over to\\nGod, it became impactful. This is a major secret of Moses’ generational impact\\nwith God.Beloved, when you surrender your certificate, your expertise, your\\nknowledge, your wisdom, and talent to God, He will turn them into generational\\ntools of impact in your hand. When you come to the end of yourself, you are at\\nthe beginning with God.Remember this: When you come to the end of yourself,\\nyou are at the beginning with God.

Like Moses, submit your rod of human\\nconnections, certificate, expertise, knowledge and talents before God in order\\nto experience a new beginning with Him.2. Do not lean on your own\\nunderstanding; trust and look unto God absolutely.PRAYER: O Lord, I receive\\nYour help to surrender my life and all that I have before You.

He says, “Before I can use you, you must surrender\\nyourself to Me for chiseling. Surrender yourself to Me; let Me remove some\\nthings from your life that are preventing Me from anointing you the way I\\nshould. Surrender yourself to Me; let me remove some things in order for you\\nto be qualified to be effective.” Culled from “THOU ART MY BATTLE AXE” by Dr\\nPaul Enenche.DAILY BIBLE READING: Proverbs 19-21AMAZING FACT: Statistics shows\\nsignificant impact of church attendance on humanity: 68% of church-goers\\nbecome better after going to church; 69% get their kids helped; 66% get\\ncomforted and 81% build their relationship with God.PROPHETIC\\nWORD/DECLARATION: Whatever was useless in your hands before now, as you\\nsurrender them to God, you shall experience awesome impact through them in\\nJesus’ Name.\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': 'On my WhatsApp status, I posted on May 2: If you are still speaking in tongues\\nin May, 2020: and Christ hasn’t shown you 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 for you to\\nquit, then what you are doing is an incantation and influenced by an evil\\nspirit.Then my friend responded: I don\\'t understand. To say am confused is\\nstill an understatement, more because I was planning to re-evaluate, fast if\\npossible for that gift.“All that tongue speaking in many churches is not the\\ntrue one“, I replied. “All churches do so”, she returned “No. Catholic,\\nBaptist, all reformed churches, Anglican, and Deeper life, don’t practice it”,\\nI countered.After knowing that she had sought the “gift of speaking in\\ntongues” for years, this led to the exposition on the “gift of tongues” from\\nthe Old Testament to New Testament. Here goes the exposition:\\n.........…………………………………………………………………“Tongues” means “languages” or “dialects”.\\nThe “gift of tongues“ spoken of in the letters of Apostle Luke - Acts of the\\nApostles, and Apostle Paul, was first spoken of by Prophet Isaiah as the means\\nGod will employ in the proclamation of Himself to the Gentiles, in a language\\nunderstood by them - their own dialect:Isaiah says: Very well then, with\\nforeign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people (Isaiah 28:11).\\nTwo verses prior showed the dilemma of interpretation (of God’s message to the\\nGentiles): \"To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He interpret\\nthe message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the\\nbreast?(Isaiah 28:9)The Old Testament summary: God says He would speak to\\npeoples (who did not know Him) in their own tongue (by\\ninterpretation).…………………………………………………………………………..In the synoptic gospels, Jesus\\nspeaks to a Syro-Phoenician woman in her own tongue. (The language of\\nPhoenicia is Punic or Phoenician, Proto Semitic languages). Thereafter, He\\nspeaks to a deaf mute in sign language. In Acts 2, the disciples of Jesus\\nspoke about fifteen tongues, languages they’ve never learned, to people from\\ndifferent countries; speaking about things concerning Christ.Acts 2:8,11: And\\nhow is it that we each hear them in our own language to which we were born?\\nCretans and Arabs- we hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty\\ndeeds of God.\"In Acts 10, an Italian, Cornelius, who was kind to the Jews\\n(v.2), spoke in a language understood by the Jews who accompanied Peter;\\nhence, they were astonished (v.45). In Acts 19, the language spoken is\\nimpossible to identify. However, a commonality exists with the prior eye-\\nwitness accounts - preaching about Christ was happening (v.4&5).The eye-\\nwitnesses’ account summary: The (“new”) language spoken by the Gentile\\nconverts occurred during the preaching of the gospel of Christ to them by\\nJews. Whenever the gift of tongues was in operation Jews were present. The\\ninitial preachers to the Gentiles, Jesus Christ and the Apostles, proclaimed\\nthe word of God to the Gentiles in Gentile language.\\n……………………………………………………………………….In Apostle’s Paul’s first letter to the\\nCorinthians, he addresses the maladies in that church; the build-up to the\\n“problem“ of tongues began in chapter 10. Summarily, the maladies were:1. In\\nChapter 10: Idolatry.2 In Chapter 11: They didn’t imitate Paul and they didn’t\\nimitate Christ; in other words:A. Natural law for leadership was jettisoned B.\\nThe Lord’s supper was a place of division; and the gathering was a gallery of\\ngluttony.3: Chapter 12: Chapter 12 is divided into two parts; the two\\ndivisions are separated by the word “now” in verse 4 - Now there are varieties\\nof gifts, but the same Spirit. (Now: adverb: used, especially in conversation,\\nto draw attention to a particular statement or point in a narrative. )The word\\n“now” contrasts the malady in verse 1 to 3, with the narrative- the real\\noperation of the Holy Spirit in the Church (1 Corinthians 12:8-30).The malady\\nshown in first three verses was the infusion of native custom of idol worship\\ninto Christianity. In a euphemism, Apostle Paul states the display in the\\nchurch influenced by the pagan spirit, as revealed itself by an oral\\nexpression:You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were\\ninfluenced and led astray to mute idols. (1 Corinthians 12:2)Therefore I want\\nyou to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be\\ncursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit. (1\\nCorinthians 12:3)The content of this speech influenced by this pagan spirit\\ndoesn’t proclaim the gospel of Christ - it doesn’t say, “Jesus is Lord”. Paul\\ndoesn’t waste his time going into details of how they were “carried away” when\\nhe says: “somehow or another”.However, In Ifá worship for instance, the\\ndevotee are carried away to the deity by way of the ògèdè/ọfọ̀ spoken by the\\nBabaláwo. Just like Isaiah wrote: They will say to you, \"Seek oracles at the\\npits used to conjure up underworld spirits, from the magicians who chirp and\\nmutter incantations.The muttering that went on in the Corinthian church was\\nincantation-like: the tongue in verse 3, was done in a display (like those\\ndone when the heathen appear before their pagan deities).Later in Chapter\\n12:10, Paul speaks of another kind of tongues, different from that spoken of\\nin verse 2. The incantation-like expression spoken of in verse 2 is in\\ncontrast to the tongues in verse 10 which is in plurality as verse 28 shows -\\nvarious languages. The gift of tongues in chapter 12:10 walks in tandem with\\nall the gifts of the spirit; none working independently; Where the gift of\\n“word of wisdom” was, “tongues” will be in effect; Where there were apostles,\\nprophets and teachers carrying on with the preaching of the gospel of Christ,\\nthe gifts in unison would verify their ministry. From the tone of rebuke in\\nchapter 10 and 11, the tongue displayed in verse 2, was done by all and\\nsundry. Paul ends the chapter by stating the inferiority of those gifts\\nincluding “the gift of tongues”.There are nine gifts spoken of in chapter 12.\\nThree of them make their way into the next chapter. Then Paul speaks of these\\ninferior gifts in detail; and how their inferiority comes with their\\nexpiration.The next chapter presented the ultimate gift - love. In chapter\\n13:8, Paul says: “Love never fails”. “Fail”, katargeō in Greek language means\\n“expire”. Then he speaks of the manner of expiration the gifts in chapter 12\\nwould occur:1. Prophecies will fail: Failure indicts that it will not stand\\nthe test of time.2. Tongues will cease: “Cease” means to stop completely or\\ncome to an end.3. Knowledge will vanish away: “Vanish away” means to fade\\naway. It brings to mind how the gas in a gas cylinder begins to die off until\\nit is empty.Chapter 13:9 says, the prophecy made by the apostles, prophets and\\nteachers, and the knowledge they possess is partial (incomplete). Then,\\nChapter 13:10 shows that those gifts were for the church in its tender years.\\nHowever, when the church is mature, those gifts will finally give way. Paul\\nsays, “the perfect will come, then the partial gifts will be discarded“. So,\\nwhat then is the perfect (gift)? The perfect (gift) cannot be the coming of\\nChrist because of the qualities associated with the gifts - failure and\\nvanishing. At the coming of Christ, all things stop. The earlier verses says,\\nit is love. Much more, John in his first epistle says, it is love. What then\\nis this love that shows up when the church has left its childish state? Paul\\nsays, it is the truth in love, the full knowledge of the Jesus, the Gospels of\\nChrist (Eph. 4:13-16, 2 Tim.3:16-17); John says, “but whoever keeps His word,\\nin him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are\\nin Him”. The word of God is termed “love”. Finally, we have a verse in the\\nscriptures if not handled carefully throws everything said by the prophet into\\nthe flames - 1 Corinthians 14:2: For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak\\nto men but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks\\nmysteries.………………………………………………………………………….“This chapter is crowded with\\ndifficulties“, so says Adam Clarke about 1 Corinthians 14. To understand one\\npagan affiliation, it would be important to look at another pagan affiliation\\none is familiar with so that the difficulties Adam Clarke speaks of will be\\naverted. In Ifá worship, it is typical that when the Babaláwo begins to mutter\\nthe ọfọ̀, an ọ̀gbẹ̀rì would not understand. In the Babaláwo‘s mind, he speaks\\nmysteries (ancient secrets of the past) only Ifá understands; though the\\nBabaláwo may not understand fully, yet he speaks them. The ọ̀gbẹ̀rì doesn’t\\nunderstand because he is an illiterate with respect to the training one is\\nrequired to go through to “read” and understand the words of the Babaláwo.1\\nCorinthians 14:3 shows that Paul isn’t referring to the traditions mentioned\\nin chapter 12:2; but he is referring to a present unfavorable practice in the\\nchurch; and the need to desire prophesying (interpretations: v.1).1. The\\nBabaláwo is the religious equivalent to a Christian minister. In the manner\\nthe Babaláwo does, the church ministers at Corinth spoke (without\\ninterpretation) to the ọ̀gbẹ̀rì. But this is Christianity not paganism, hence,\\nPaul speaks of the need for the interpretation of the tongue of the text\\n(verse 1&11)2. The synagogue in the Greek nation of Corinth like in all\\nsynagogues Apostle Paul visited, read the Hebrew texts - the Torah (The Five\\nBooks of Moses), Nevi\\'im (\\'Prophets\\') and Ketuvim (\\'Writings\\'), which make up\\nour Old Testament scriptures. When these texts are read, the congregation of\\nGreeks would never understand; so the purpose of reading is unfruitful, and\\nthese leaves the Gentiles with a feeling of disrespect or dissatisfaction; So\\nthey might say, “na only him and God understand wetin he dey talk”, so does\\nPaul say: “For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God;\\nfor no one understands”. The reader of the Hebrew texts always made a vain\\neffort in communing with the unlearned congregation in a foreign\\ntongue;Therefore, Paul admonished the gifted to pray and sing the psalms,\\nhymns and spiritual songs according to the spirit of the Torah, Nevi\\'im and\\nKetuvim, and according to the gifted’s mind (“mind” means “mental disposition”\\nor “vital principle”. Mental disposition is what drives our emotions, desires,\\naffection etc.): “I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind\\nalso; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also”.The\\nspeaker of the foreign tongue spoke mysteries, the verse says. Paul speaks of\\nthe ancient texts’ picturesque expressions of Christ as mysteries in Colossian\\n1:26. He prayed that the Gentiles would understand the mysteries in the Jewish\\nancient texts concerning the Christ (Eph. 6:19, Col. 4:3, 1:26,27). This made\\nit imperative that the unknown tongue of the Torah, Nevi\\'im, and Ketuvim\\nneeded interpretation and its mysteries uncovered for the benefit of unlearned\\nhearers. This is why he admonished them in verse 1 not to desire to speak in\\nthe Hebrew tongue but to desire to interpret(prophecy) the Hebrew tongue in\\nwhich Torah, Nevi\\'im and Ketuvim were written in, in the Corinth dialect.What\\nis practiced as the “gift of tongues” by the Pentecostal church and many of\\nits admirers for the better part of the last century is more like the 1\\nCorinthians 12:2 case. It is not a gospel speaking speech: It is antithetical\\nto the pattern of the scriptures and the spirit of the gospel of Christ. It is\\ncontrary to the instruction of the 1689 confession of faith that states that\\n“all parts of religious worship of God are to be performed with\\nunderstanding”. It churns the stomach of the early church fathers who for the\\nprimacy of the people’s edification stated through the principles of the\\nWestminster confession of Faith that: “The goal is the hearers’ understanding\\nof, and growth in, the Word of God, not the display of the preacher’s\\neloquence or erudition. At least a dozen times the Directory urges plainness\\nor clarity of expression in preaching in order that “the meanest [humblest]\\nmay understand.”I now know why it was sickening for Paul to speak about it.\\nThis is a long read but it takes time to dissolve an iceberg; Don’t let it\\nweary you, please. Tongues is not for the real children of God who have found\\ngrace in Christ. May the Lord be with us all. (For the non-Yoruba: ọ̀gbẹ̀rì\\nmeans unlearned or illiterate. ògèdè/ọfọ̀ means incantations. Babaláwo is the\\nPriest of Ifá. Ifá is the Yoruba divination deity).Cc: Toyorlee1, Nebes,\\nMaximus69, Eulalia, MuttleyLaffAcehart\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': \"How About We Tear Down The Statue Of Planned Parenthood Racist Founder?Planned\\nParenthood founder Margaret Sanger spoke at KKK rallies and advocated for\\nreducing the number of black children being born.Fri Aug 18, 2017 - 3:42 pm\\nEST WASHINGTON, D.C., August 18, 2017 (LifeSiteNews) — In recent weeks,\\nheadlines from town and cities across America have highlighted the removal of\\nstatues commemorating Civil War-era confederate figures from public squares\\nand buildings. Yet a statue remains in Washington D.C.’s Smithsonian\\nInstitution commemorating the one person responsible for the deaths of more\\nAfrican Americans that any other in history: Margaret Sanger, founder of\\nPlanned Parenthood.“More than 19 million black babies have been aborted since\\nthe 1973 Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision legalized abortion in our\\ncountry,” according to Michigan Right to Life’s website. “On average, 900\\nblack babies are aborted every day in the United States.” Planned Parenthood\\nis responsible for many of those abortions.In August 2015, a group of Black\\npastors gathered in front of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery to\\nmake known their plea for the removal of Sanger’s bust from the museum. Their\\nrequest was rejected and the bust of Planned Parenthood’s founder remains on\\ndisplay today.Asked about the continued presence of the bust at the museum,\\nLinda St. Thomas, director of public affairs for the Smithsonian, emphasized\\nto LifeSiteNews, “The Sanger statue has been there for many, many years.” But\\nso too have statues commemorating Confederate figures also been on display\\naround the country for many, many years — until now. If Sanger had her way,\\nMLK and Rosa Parks would not have been bornRegarding the presence of Sanger’s\\nbust in the Museum’s “Struggle for Justice” display, the pastors wrote a\\nletter to the museum’s director, “Perhaps the Gallery is unaware that Ms.\\nSanger supported black eugenics, a racist attitude toward black and other\\nminority babies; an elitist attitude toward those she regarded as ‘the feeble\\nminded; speaking at rallies of Ku Klux Klan women; and communications with\\nHitler sympathizers.” Their letter continues, “Also, the notorious ‘Negro\\nProject’ which sought to limit, if not eliminate, black births, was her brain\\nchild. Despite these well-documented facts of history, her bust sits proudly\\nin your gallery as a hero of justice. The obvious incongruity is staggering!”\\n“Like Hitler, Sanger advocated eugenics — the extermination of people she\\ndeemed ‘undesirables,’” said the pastors. “Ironically, Sanger’s bust is\\nfeatured in the NPG’s [National Portrait Gallery’s] ‘Struggle for Justice’\\nexhibit alongside two of America’s most celebrated and authentic champions of\\nequal rights — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. If Sanger had her\\nway, MLK and Rosa Parks would not have been born.” Sanger ‘was no hero’Planned\\nParenthood locates 70 percent of its abortion facilities within or near black\\nand Latino communities, suppressing the growth of minority populations, and so\\nthe pastors point out, “This explains why elective abortion remains the number\\none cause of death among black Americans, higher than all other causes\\ncombined. We will not remain silent while the National Portrait Gallery\\nvenerates someone who sought to eradicate our very existence. Ms. Sanger was a\\nracist, elitist, and her beliefs led to massive destruction of unborn human\\nlife. She was no hero.”Black activist Star Parker told LifeNews in 2015,\\n“Margaret Sanger is a racist who wanted to end the black population through\\nbirth control and abortion. She founded Planned Parenthood. But The\\nSmithsonian, funded by our tax dollars, celebrates this woman, even mentioning\\nher advocacy of eugenics! They don’t even hide it! It is breathtaking in its\\nidiocy.”Sanger’s statue belongs with those of Hitler, Stalin and Dr.\\nMengeleBishop E.W. Jackson, president and founder of the Ministers Taking a\\nStand that wrote the letter, told CNSNews.com that the National Portrait\\nGallery's response to the pastors “avoids the issue and whitewashes\\nSanger.”“If they must recognize her ‘historical significance,’ place her with\\nbusts of Pharaoh, Herod, Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Goebbels, Pol Pot and Dr.\\nMengele,” continued Bishop Jackson to CNSNews. “This would put her in her\\nproper historical context with the infamous and evil figures who committed\\ngenocide.”The hypocrisy of Planned Parenthood in one tweet“Planned Parenthood,\\nthe American abortion provider that mercilessly takes the lives of\\napproximately 200,000 innocent people of colour every year, took to social\\nmedia earlier this week to condemn racism in the wake of civil unrest in\\nCharlottesville, Virginia,” the Babylon Bee reported.The posting continued,\\n‘Planned Parenthood stands with people of colour and allies in the face of\\nsuch appalling attacks fuelled by hate,” said the update posted to the\\nFacebook and Twitter pages of the organization, which overwhelmingly targets\\nminority communities with its facilities and abortion services, resulting in\\nunborn babies of colour being aborted at a rate multiple times higher than\\nthat of white babies.”The Smithsonian’s response to the black pastors’\\ngroupSmithsonian director Kim Sajet said, “I received your letter regarding\\nthe legacy of Margaret Sanger and respectfully decline to remove her portrait\\nfrom the museum. The Struggle for Justice gallery brings attention to major\\ncultural and political figures from the 19th century to the present day who\\nfought to achieve civil rights for disenfranchised or marginalized\\ngroups.”Sajet added, “Her association with the eugenics movement shadowed her\\nachievements in sex education and contraception, making her a figure of\\ncontroversy, one whose complexities and contradictions mirror her times. There\\nis no ‘moral test’ for people to be accepted into the National Portrait\\nGallery.”Source\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': \"[b][/b]Samuel is about the most sincere storyteller I have met in recent\\ntimes. His account of events was sincere. “I was raised by an impecunious\\nfather. We lived under continuous years of penury. That was the kind of life\\nthat I was raised into- a pedestrian life with neither dreams nor purpose. As\\nI became older, I heard stories about my grandfather and his father, my great\\ngrandfather. They did not help my father's case and mine even by the smallest\\nmargin. My grandfather mortgaged all the family plots of land to fund his\\ndrinking life. He was known as a dipsomaniac even in far away neighbouring\\ncommunities. There was a story about my grandfather being beaten up\\ncollectively by women in our community because of the life he subjected my\\ngrandmother to. That was the height of the humiliations he had to be put\\nthrough in the community for being an addicted alcoholic. He became synonymous\\nwith failure. Parents in that era were reported to have always rebuked their\\nwards using him as an example of a failure. They always admonished them\\nsaying, ‘Do not end up like Maduka, the drunk’Samuel was clear about his\\nmission; to tell it the way it is. “This was the nature of the inheritance\\nthat he left behind for my father. The liability was too much for him to\\nsettle that he took solace in alcohol too. The situation became the tales of\\ntwo Madukas of separate generations bound by the same fate. My father became\\nentangled in the fight that he came to disengage. He was not as lucky as his\\nfather- the alcohol got to his liver. He used the lands that he recovered\\nafter settling debts owed by his father, to incur further debt in order to\\nfund his treatment. He left us with a bigger liability at death. ‘All eyes on\\nme’ in my case was not that of Tupac Shakur blasting through the speakers-\\ninstead, it was the strength of the expectations placed on me. But honestly,\\nno one, I repeat, no one gave me the chance of ever becoming somebody. I did\\nnot equally give myself any chance because I did not see any reason why I\\nshould be better than the two key men that arrived before me.” He continued,\\n“I have experienced many life-changing events in my life but one stood out.\\nThere was a day nightfall came upon my community in the day time- a woman\\nslapped a red cap chief in the village square over a small disagreement. It\\nwas a taboo in my culture to assault a chief. In fact, any woman that would\\ncommit such taboo would wish she was never born. But in this very case,\\nnothing happened. It was later muffled around that the woman was a supreme\\ncourt judge. It was an event that changed my life because prior to that, I did\\nnot know that anything could give a woman that quantum of power or control\\nover any man- much more a red cap chief. The following week, I left town to\\nunderstudy a wealthy trader from a neighbouring community. There were lots of\\nchallenges on my path but I had resolved never to end up like the two men that\\npreceded me. After seven years of meritorious service, my boss released me to\\nstart on my own. I was off the block like Usain Bolt and by a stroke of luck,\\nmade a flying progress.”As he approached the end of the story, Samuel said,\\n“Most evenings, after the close of business, we would gather at a small joint\\nto have some goodies and booze to wash it down. I decided to convert this time\\nto something more productive because I knew I needed to do something\\ndifferent. I needed that power that the female judge had. I registered for\\nadult education and started at Basic one. It was tough but within one month, I\\nwasn't relying on my sales boys to issue invoices any longer. It gave me some\\nsprings in my step- and it motivated me. I kept going and by the grace of God,\\nI obtained my first master’s degree, MSc in Business Administration, within a\\ncouple of years. My desire is to be the first PhD holder in my kindred. I was\\nmotivated by the desire to cleanse the mediocrity of my predecessors up to our\\ntenth generation. I was ready to wipe out that poverty that found its way into\\nour home.”Samuel’s phone rang. He picked it up and after speaking with the\\nperson at the other end, he smiled and said to me, “It has been confirmed. His\\nexcellency has just made me SSA(Special Senior Adviser) on economic matters. I\\ndon't know where to begin. But I give all the glory to God” REFLECTIONYou see,\\nthe choices we make are very consequential to what we become at the end of the\\nday (I agree with this submission hook, line and sinker). But I give more\\ncredit and put more credence to the reasons behind the decisions we take. The\\nreasons that inform the decisions are like those behind the camera in a movie\\nset; the film crews. People are familiar with ascribing the credit for a good\\nmovie to the cast but they forget that a good cast performance is subject to\\nthe quality of the crew. Reasons are the drivers of the choices and decisions\\nwe make. They are no less important on how our lives pan out. If you want to\\nmake good decisions, you have to find the perfect reasons.The two men in\\nPaul’s life followed a certain destiny. But Paul, who did not want to end up\\nthe same way, had to do things differently. And boy, he did just that! If you\\nwant a better life, you have to do things differently if you do not want to be\\ntied to the same result. There are pathways surrounding us. They lead to\\ndifferent destinies. Therefore, the doors we walk through or slam shut in our\\nlives determine what destiny we end up with. You must choose wisely to have a\\nbetter life.We may not have a perfect life but we have the power to improve\\nthe one we have. Whatever it is that you are going through now can be\\novercome. But first, you must decide to do things differently. It might sound\\ndifficult but the moment you find enough reasons to do something about your\\nsituation, the decisions would happen spontaneously. It is in your hands!For\\nmore inspirational stories:https://anekearinzeblog.com\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': 'This is a short section in the gospels when Jesus takes his disciples aside\\nand gives them a model of prayer they can follow. What we found as we studied\\nthis simple prayer is that it is really comprehensive! It gives a great\\nbalance between praising God and placing requests before God.What is the\\nLord’s Prayer?You’ve probably seen the LORD’s prayer before, but just in case\\nyou haven’t, here it is from Matthew 6:9b-13:‘Our Father in heaven,hallowed be\\nyour name,your kingdom come,your will be done,on earth as it is in heaven.Give\\nus today our daily bread.And forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our\\ndebtors.And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from the evil\\none.’Sometimes we say this prayer in church or may have prayed it ourselves.\\nBut do we really know what the words mean and how it can help us to pray\\nwell?Let’s break down the prayer and have a look at each section so we can be\\nbetter equipped and understand what we are saying as we pray.“Our Father in\\nheaven…”This line reminds us that we are praying to our Father in heaven, how\\ngreat is this?! We can call the God of the WHOLE universe our “father” because\\nof what Jesus has done, bringing us into God’s family. This means we can come\\nto Him as children when we pray, but it also reminds us that we need to have\\nthe correct reverence and awe of Him as a father and not just treat God like\\nour buddy or mate.“Hallowed be your name”This line sounds a little odd because\\nwe don’t really use the word “hallowed” any more, but what it means is to\\n‘honour as holy’. So we are to honour God’s name as holy and also treat Him as\\nholy. But this prayer is bigger than just for ourselves; we are to pray that\\nall across the world God’s name may be honoured as holy as people come to know\\nGod and to understand who He is.“Your kingdom come, your will be done, on\\nearth as it is in heaven”As Christians, we know that the life we live here on\\nearth is not all that there is, we know that a new heaven and a new earth are\\ncoming – this is the coming kingdom of God (Revelation 21).But we also know\\nthat God’s kingdom is being established today as people come to know Him and\\nbecome part of His family (His kingdom). So as we pray this line about God’s\\nwill being done, and God’s kingdom we should remember that we are not only\\npraying for the future but also for people to become Christians right\\nnow.“Give us today our daily bread”This line has a double meaning behind it.\\nIt asks for God to provide us with the daily necessities that we need (harking\\nback to the days when God provided food for His people for the 40 years in the\\ndesert), but it also refers to God feeding us daily through His word, The\\nBible.“And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors”Even\\nthough as Christians we know we are forgiven of our sins, it is good to pray\\nfor forgiveness for it reminds us that we are sinful and constantly fall short\\nof God’s perfect standards. We also are reminded by this line that we are to\\nforgive others. We have been forgiven so much by God, we are to show Christ-\\nlike character and forgive those who wrong us.“And lead us not into\\ntemptation, but deliver us from the evil one”Despite us having been saved by\\nJesus and the victory over sin and death having been won, there is still a\\nspiritual war happening. So we are to pray for protection from the attacks of\\nthe devil as well as praying that God help us not to wander into temptation\\nand sin.“For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever.\\nAmen”This is an added extra bit that many churches have tagged onto the end of\\nthe LORD’s Prayer that is a conclusion to the prayer. It praises God for the\\npower and glory that he has and will have for all eternity.Pray the Lord’s\\nPrayer this week!Hopefully this little break-down might help the Lord’s Prayer\\nto be slightly more accessible to you, and at least for you to know what you\\nare praying for as you recite the prayer in church.Sometimes I even like hang\\nmy prayers off this prayer, praying one line of the prayer and then praying\\nfor other things that fit under that idea. Maybe you can try something like\\nthat this week?https://thenewvine.com/2020/07/01/see-how-the-lords-prayer-can-\\nhelp-us-pray-better/\\n\\n',\n",

It is an established fact that a child will only become whatever he\\nor she sees or hears. A new born baby does not have language, food, culture,\\nreligion or wisdom; his parent, teacher, guardian and those in his environment\\ndetermine all these.Therefore, God is counting on you to train up every child\\nthat comes in contact with you the right values of life and the will of God.\\nPlace around every child what you want him or her to be in the future. A\\nfather or mother who is unfaithful, tell lies, fight their neighbours, steal\\nwhat belongs to others, keep malice, encourage disunity and selfishness,\\nengage in domestic violence, encourage malpractices and sponsors discord among\\nbrethren cannot expect a child who sees him/her to do better and live\\nrightly.Don\\'t ever say a particular child is not yours; that it is the\\nresponsibility of their biological parent to train up their wards.

              "  'content': 'Happy Sunday everyone!Today we are going to look at the differences between\\nrevenge, vengeance, and forgiveness.Revenge- when you try to get back at\\nsomeone for a wrong thing they did to you.Proverb 24:29Do not say, “I’ll do to\\nthem as they have done to me; I’ll pay them back for what they did.”Human\\nnature wants to seek revenge. It\\'s like a reflex action. When someone does\\nsomething bad to us, we want to pay back. Sometimes, we might overlook, but\\nwhen it hurts us, we want to get our pound of flesh.But seeking revenge comes\\nwith lots of cons, which is why God asks us to leave it to Him. He is the\\nmaster planner, He knows how to do it in such a way that only the person who\\nwrongs us gets the punishment. But when we take it upon ourselves to revenge,\\nmost times, we end up hurting ourselves too.ScenarioMy younger brother came\\nback one day and was fuming, saying, \"I must join the military.\" At first, I\\nthought it was his normal rant because he has had that ambition for a long\\ntime. But then, I wonder why he was angry. \"Did something happen?\" He narrated\\nhow a group of touts just picked on him for no reason and when he tried to\\ndefend himself, one hit him with a plank at the back of his head. I saw the\\nswell at the back of my brother\\'s head and I went berserk. In my rage, I said,\\n\"You\\'re still waiting for when you will enter the military, call so so the\\nperson and enter barracks now.\" He left. When he came back, he looked happy.\\nWhat happened? He gave me the story of how they got soldiers that went there,\\nbeat up the boys, and took some of them to the guard room. \"Wait, you went\\nthere with them? What if someone had hit you?\" He tried to explain how that\\nwon\\'t happen as he is prepared. And then he said they were going there\\ntomorrow. \"Going where? Please, don\\'t go anywhere o. I have a feeling they\\nwill retaliate. I had to dissuade him from going there the next day. You see,\\nI was only thinking of my anger, my brother\\'s anger, and revenge. In the fit\\nof my anger, I didn\\'t think of what could go wrong. I didn\\'t think of how my\\nbrother could get harmed. I was just concentrating on revenge. God will never\\nhave such myopic thinking.Another scenarioA friend of mine, the one I wrote of\\nin one of my threads got me a job in one of the departments in the barracks\\nbefore he got posted. The only problem was that the post wasn\\'t approved yet\\nbecause the new commandant was yet to settle down.The head of the department\\nwas a married man who will always call my phone in the night to say all sorts\\nof rubbish. Now, this man will not say anything when I\\'m in the office, it\\'s\\nwhen I\\'ve gotten home at night.I so much loved the job, like it was a flexing\\njob. I was handling a new program they had just initiated, there was free\\nlunch with champagne, and closing hours was three. I wasn\\'t too keen on giving\\nit up. And by that time my friend had been posted.What I do is when he calls,\\nI\\'ll listen for a few minutes then cut and switch off my phone. I\\'ll then call\\nin the morning and tell him my battery was low. This went on for some time\\nuntil I decided I\\'ve had enough.I picked his call that night, when he started\\ntalking, I cut the call. He called back, I didn\\'t pick. He kept calling until\\nhe got tired. I didn\\'t go to work that day, and he didn\\'t call to find out. I\\nknew it was over. But my heart was set on revenge.I had some documents\\nregarding the program with me. Now, I\\'m not going into details of what I did,\\nbecause it\\'s kind of sensitive. But just know there was a full-blown\\ninvestigation and it took the grace of God for it not to get linked to me. You\\nknow those Indian films when someone wants to get caught for something they\\ndid, and at that very moment something takes the attention of everyone giving\\nthe person a chance to destroy evidence, that\\'s what happened to me.

The\\nprogram flourished.\\n\\n',\n",
              "  'response': 'Forgiveness- when you don\\'t dwell on the wrong someone did to you.Ephesians\\n4:31-32 – Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, and slander, along\\nwith every form of malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving\\none another, as God in Christ forgave you.Proverbs 17:9 – Love prospers when a\\nfault is forgiven, but dwelling on it separates close friends.Forgiveness\\nmeans forgiving people irrespective of what they\\'ve done to you and how many\\ntimes they\\'ve wronged you. We are talking about 70*7 every day!Forgiveness is\\nfor those who want to be like Christ. Specifically asking God for vengeance is\\nlike living in the old testament time. Forgiveness in Christianity. It\\'s\\ndefinitely not easy.For someone like me, I\\'ve had people betray me. My\\nimmediate elder brother is one of them. In short, he had the habit of\\nbetraying me and I\\'ve forgiven him countless times. But the last he did, was\\njust terrible. And I couldn\\'t bring myself to forgive him. I stopped talking\\nto him too.To me, he was to blame for all the terrible things that happened to\\nme while I was in school. I held on to the grudges and accused him before God,\\nand he suffered. Whenever I heard something good has happened, like devil the\\naccuser, I accused him. It went on like this until I started drawing close to\\nGod. Along with everyone that had wronged me, I started trying to forgive him.\\nIt wasn\\'t easy. Sometimes I\\'ll think I have forgiven him, but I just needed to\\nremember what he did, and I\\'ll go back to square one. Then I started praying\\nfor him. I prayed for his forgiveness, success, protection, and then I saw it\\nwas easy to forgive him. That was when I understood why God said we should\\npray for those who hurt us. You will find it difficult to keep bearing grudges\\nwhen you pray for them.Luke 6:28Bless those who curse you, pray for those who\\nmistreat you.Forgiveness is not easy, especially when someone does something\\ngruesome to you. It could be wrong accusations, rape, killing your child,\\nsleeping with your spouse, etc.But the grace of God makes all things easy,\\nwhich is why we should always depend on God for strength. Tell God to heal\\nyour heart. You can only forgive when the wounds are healed. It is why I told\\na nairalander who said he became a hardened criminal when his mother accused\\nhim of stealing, \"Thank God for healing your heart.\"Did I benefit from\\nforgiving my brother? Of course. He called me on my birthday and sent almost a\\n100k to me. This is something he has never done in his life.Let us all try to\\nforgive one another so that we can also obtain mercy from God. We all have our\\nnegative sides. And we strive for perfection every day. Let\\'s help each other\\nstrive for that perfection, and let God take care of those that need\\npunishment.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Homo Sapiens 15: 1-191. Rastus was born in the 910th year of the homo sapiens\\nera.2. Now he was born in a town in the present day Spain. Now his father was\\nMiguel who was an archer.3. When Rastus had grown to the age of twenty-two, he\\nsank in the river and drank a lot of water.4. Then he was rescued by some\\nfishermen.5. Now when Rastus had recovered, he became very quiet. Then he said\\nto his parents, I have seen another world.6. When Miguel had asked him to tell\\nhim what he saw, he said, if I tell you, you shall not believe me.7. Then\\nMiguel swore, saying, I shall believe you. Then Rastus said, let this oath be\\nobserved as you have made it.8. Then he said, I saw myself in a place which\\nseemed more real than this earth itself.9. I saw myself in the past when my\\nappearance was different from what I am now.10. I saw the things which I did\\nin the past. I also saw my father in the past.11. I saw your mother, who is my\\ngrandmother in the present days. I saw many whom I did not know earlier that I\\nknew.12. When Rastus continued, Miguel said, you have continued to speak of\\nthe people whom you saw, what about god Busket the creator of everyone?13.\\nThen Rastus said, I saw Busket also, but he is not in any way different from\\nthe others whom I saw.14. He is not set aside to be worshipped there as we\\nworship him here on earth.15. There seemed to be equality of rank in that\\nplace where I went. There were neither priests nor king in the place which I\\nsaw.16. Father, the place which I saw is as peaceful as two thousand deep\\nsleep put together.17. I did not want to return to the earth but my present\\ngrandmother and my past father said to me that my time was not up.18. They\\nsaid that the fishermen coming close to the river will rescue me if I chose to\\nreturn to the earth, but if I insist on remaining with them, the fishermen\\nwill not notice me.19. Then I listened to them and now I am back. Now among\\nall those whom I saw, it was only Busket whom you and I worshipped as the\\ncreator that did not smile at me because he knew what I would be returning to\\nthe earth to do.20. When Miguel had heard the sayings of his son, he was\\nspeechless.21. Now Rastus began to gather many people of the land, saying,\\ncome and let us observe all the myths and legends of the land.22. Let us study\\nnature and establish what is true and what is false.23. So Rastus had many\\npeople who observed things with him. Then the priests of Busket became his\\nenemies and opposed him, but he did not give up.24. Now many superstitions of\\nthe land were discarded by the followers of Rastus, because the priests of\\nBusket had demanded from the gatherers of fruits and the hunters daily\\nsacrifices of fruits and meat, saying that whoever refused to do so shall be\\nstruck dead by Busket.25. Now when Rastus and his followers did not make\\nsacrifices to Busket and were not struck dead, many people of the land began\\nto see Rastus himself as a greater god than Busket and they worshipped him\\nrather than Busket.26. So the worship of Rastus lasted till the 31st century\\nof the homo sapiens era in Spain, Portugal and some other places in Europe.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'The number of Churches planted in June 2020, in spite of the lockdown, is\\nbeyond what was planted in 2014We are invading the villages, rural areas with\\nthe GospelBeing on the go for Jesus makes you wiser by the day.You will never\\nrun out of answers with meditation. Meditation provides supernatural access to\\nthe mind of God. That’s a word from God, somebody is tapping into it. No city\\nis too hard for wisdom to take, no nation is too hard for wisdom to take\\n(Deuteronomy 2:36). You ask, how did you go about planting 614 churches in the\\nmonth of June? Insight.How do you keep winning souls as a Church in spite of\\nlock down? InsightCan you lock down the Sun by any political policy, you will\\nbe wasting time.Whatever power that cannot cover the Sun from shinning, can’t\\ncover the Church from going forward. Please wake up. “Jesus, I desire the way\\nforward.” No excuse is tenable for nonperformance.I asked the Lord, “don’t let\\nme leave this village the way I met it” in 1973 and light came: I saw that\\ngoing from house to house, to bless them is the cheapest way to get them. I\\nwasn’t speaking the language of the place but there’s a way out…So, I got hold\\nsomeone, who was also a teacher in that place and I said, “Hello, your name is\\nAbraham, you’ve been to Church in your life before? He said Yes.” He became my\\ninterpreter.We went from house to house, to bless them early in the morning\\nbefore they go to the farm; leading them to Jesus through prayers. After\\nblessing them, “would you pray this prayer after me, it’s the only way to\\nretain this blessing. You don’t pray this prayer, you can’t retain the\\nblessing.” One by one, got them saved. “This prayer continues on Sunday\\nmorning at the Teacher’s house.”Response: YesThe villagers were very\\nexcited…Within 40 days, we built a Church. Nothing can stop wisdom from having\\nits way, He planted His Church and I encountered destiny there. “The Light you\\nhave brought to our village, let it shine around the world” – It is shining\\ntoday.Please ask God for the way forward, the same order of result is not\\ntenable. If your child goes to school and he is in the same class every year.\\nYou say, “what class are you again?” He said, “I’m in Primary Two.” Then the\\nfollowing year, “I’m in Primary Two.” The third year, “I’m in Primary Two”,\\nyou’ll say: please come out of the place. Come and learn farming by hoe and\\ncutlass.Prayer: “Jesus, let there be a release of heavenly order of wisdom\\nupon this Church, upon our online worshippers to be effective instruments in\\nyour hand, on the harvest field.” You know what shocked the devil? The result\\nthat my Outreach team gets this time is more than when there was no lock down.\\nUntil you can lock down communication between one and another, you can’t lock\\ndown the gospel. I tell you.Number of churches we planted in the month of June\\nis more than what we planted in the whole year of 2014. Don’t toy with God.…I\\nwill make a way in the wilderness, streams in the desert (Isaiah 43:19)We\\nstill have thousands of Churches we are planting this year, not one drop. We\\nare invading the villages, the cottages with the gospel because He wants ALL\\ntribes, ALL tongues, ALL kindreds (meaning families) saved. Thank You\\nJesus.You will not miss your place in this wave. This wave will change your\\nstory forever. This wave will rewrite your story forever in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n',\n",

Someone else entered the room to have a word\\nwith the pretty lady but I did not view closely who that was. I was taken away\\nby some thoughts I can not remember what those were. Suddenly, someone walked\\ninto the room, a lady in her late 30\\'s or 40\\'s I presumed.

She left immediately for her duty post\\nexpecting me to hurriedly come so they could attend to me.As I was about\\nleaving the large room, the pretty lady started talking to me, asking me\\nquestions I do not understand but seem like, \"someone is interested in you or\\nyour company\". I was answering and leaving at the same time when she got up\\nfrom where she was seated not minding the other person talking to her. It was\\nlike she was bored with the other person\\'s talk. The pretty lady came to me\\noutside the large office as I was going to the medication office and we got\\ntalking on the way. On the way, she said I did not care about her, I have\\nnever cared; probably maybe someone showing advances all this while, and I\\nhave never cared to observe. I told her I liked her. She then stood for a\\nwhile with shock of disbelief and then continued walking with me.At some\\npoint, I could not see the actual office the ladies in her 30\\'s and 40\\'s went\\ninto. It seemed she worked in the institution but I was meant to follow her...\\nto where ever she was going. The buildings that led to the place she entered\\nwas so confusing that I could not locate the entrance of where she entered.

He\\nhad abundant animals and crops, many children and numerous homes. Allah Ta‘ala\\nthen decided to test Nabi Ayyoob (‘alaihis salaam). Hence, he lost all his\\nwealth and even his children. Allah Ta‘ala even tested Nabi Ayyoob (‘alaihis\\nsalaam) with an illness that afflicted his entire body. The only two limbs of\\nhis body that were spared from this illness were his tongue and his heart.\\nNevertheless, even in this condition, he would keep his heart and tongue\\nengaged in the remembrance of Allah Ta‘ala.As for the respected wife of Nabi\\nAyyoob (‘alaihis salaam), there are two views regarding her name. According to\\nsome ‘Ulama, her name was Layyaa, while other ‘Ulama have mentioned that her\\nname was Rahmah.While Nabi Ayyoob (‘alaihis salaam) was patiently enduring\\nthis test, most of the people abandoned him, until he was left alone in a\\ncorner of the town. However, his loyal wife never left him or abandoned him.\\nShe remembered his favour upon her when conditions were favourable, and hence\\nshe remained at his side through thick and thin, ever loyal and faithful.She\\nwould patiently tend to him and see to all his needs. In some narrations, it\\nhas even been mentioned that when her wealth was eventually depleted, she\\nbegan to carry out domestic work in peoples’ homes in order to earn a living\\nand see to her ailing husband’s needs. Together with this, she had lost her\\nchildren and her husband was extremely sick. Through all these tests, she\\nremained patient and did not complain, even though she went from a life of\\ncomfort and happiness to one of difficulty and sadness.(Al-Bidaayah wan\\nNihaayah vol. 1 pg. 262)Lessons:1. The proverb “a friend in need is a friend\\nindeed” is often quoted, highlighting the fact that a true friend is one who\\nwill remain with you in difficult times as well as good times. We can well\\nimagine that if such loyalty is expected of a good friend, then what must be\\nthe high level of loyalty that is expected of a true spouse? After all, the\\nrelationship between the husband and wife far surpasses any friendship! Hence,\\na true, loyal wife is not one who will abscond to her father’s house when “the\\ngoings get tough”. Rather, she will patiently remain with her husband and\\nassist him, to the best of her ability, as she would expect of him had she\\nbeen in difficulty.2. Undergoing tests is an unavoidable occurrence in life.\\nWe cannot choose the nature or time of our tests – but we can choose to pass\\nthe tests. To do so, we will have to hold firmly to sabr (patience) and remain\\npleased with the decision of Allah Ta‘ala.\\n\\n',\n",

He deserves your praise.How To Know Someone Is About To Commit Suicide•\\nGreat People Celebrate Their BirthdayGenesis 40:20[20]And it came to pass the\\nthird day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his\\nservants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker\\namong his servants.In those days, when Egypt was the world’s powerhouse.\\nPharoah, the king of Egypt celebrated his birthday.In addition to this, he\\nmade a feast for all his servants. Today, we can call that a birthday\\nparty.So, great people who are in position of power celebrate their\\nday.Everyone wants to become great, right? But the point is, we automatically\\nbecome great as we emulate some good habits great people have.We start by\\nemulating the good habits of great people. You are to prepare for the big days\\nahead of you.Although, you may not have the money to organize a big birthday\\nparty. But, do it in a little way you can afford.HerodAlso, Herod celebrated\\nhis day too;Mark 6:21[21]And when a convenient day was come, that HEROD ON HIS\\nBIRTHDAY MADE A SUPPER to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of\\nGalilee.Herod was the governor of Galilee (Luke 3:1) at that time. In his\\ndays, he celebrated his birthday. Forget about his bad side.He also had a\\nbirthday party which eminent personalities attended. People were trilled as\\nthey were entertained by entertainers.Although, we are not commanded anywhere\\nin the Bible to celebrate our birthdays. We are told to number our days which\\nsignifies birthday celebration.Also, we were not commanded anywhere in the\\nBible not to celebrate our birthdays.But as you become influential, people you\\nhave impacted positively will want to celebrate the day you were born.You may\\nnot have the opportunity to celebrate your birth anniversary in a big way. But\\nbear it in mind that as you raise men, people will celebrate you.I believe,\\nyou’d be better off celebrating your day on a low-cost budget. Rather than not\\ncelebrating it at all.Read: Six Wrong Reasons For Attending Church• To Apply\\nYour Heart To WisdomPsalms 90:12[12]So teach us to number our days, that we\\nmay apply our hearts unto wisdom.This bible verse simply means your birthday\\nis a day of assessment. How have I been living till today? Have I been living\\na life that adds value?What have I been doing wrong? What do I need to change\\nabout my lifestyle?How do we apply our hearts to wisdom as we celebrate our\\nbirthdays?The truth is, as you are aging, you are getting closed to the day of\\nyour death.Job’s WordsHence, Job talked about the fact that; the man that is\\nborn of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble (Job 14:1). We only have\\nfew days.This truth must be remembered by us every time we celebrate our\\nbirthday.Anytime you celebrate your birth anniversary, remember this\\ntruth.Because despite the glamour, glory and riches that are in this world. We\\nare going to leave this world one day.Again, we must live under a constant\\napprehension of the shortness and uncertainty of life. And the near approach\\nof death and eternity.Anyone who does not know the day he was born, may not be\\nable to know his age and realize his/her closeness to death.But, this\\ncelebration provides an avenue for us to think about life. On that day, as you\\nthink on how you’ve been living.You may have to take a decision to live a life\\nthat adds value to people’s life.Instead of living a life that will bring you\\nsorrow at the end of your sojourn on earth. We celebrate our day in order to\\napply our hearts to wisdom.What You Should Know About Birthday• Do not\\norganize birthday to fulfil the lust of the flesh. It is to be celebrated to\\nreveal your heart of gratitude to God for your existence.• Please, if you\\ndon’t have the money to organize a big birthday party, just enjoy yourself on\\nthat day.

In what way are\\nthe opened and road side markets more organized than the church which\\nwarranted their opening?“Is it not our members in the places of worship that\\ndo go to markets and other sectors opened? Why are they allowed to go to\\nmarkets and disallowed from going to places of worship? Is it because the\\nmarketers cannot contact the virus in the markets and airports?“It is our\\nopinion that while the government and other relevant stakeholders are working\\nhard to get cure for the COVID-19 pandemic, the Church too has a role to play\\nby seeking for divine solutions as well”.CAN appealed to the Lagos, Ogun and\\nother state governments where churches are still under lockdown to: “relax it\\nfor God’s sake”.Ayokunle said: “As much as we believe that COVID-19 deserves\\nattention, it is our belief that the affected state governments would not turn\\na deaf ear to our quest but allow worship to return to places of\\nworship”.https://thenationonlineng.net/can-to-states-reopen-all-worship-\\ncentres/\\n\\n',\n",

Man’s righteousness is like a\\nfilthy rag before the Most Holy One. Many years ago, during a meditation\\nsession at a conference, I fell into a trance in which I found myself among\\nangels. They were all so pure that you could practically see through them;\\nthen I looked at myself and I was disgustingly filthy. This was surprising\\nthen because I was already a holiness preacher. If anyone had told me I was\\nthat dirty, I would have argued with them, but I could see it for\\nmyself.Everyone may see you like a spiritual giant, but don’t be fooled; to\\nGod, you are still a baby. Never come before Him stating all your credentials\\n– “I pay my tithe, I preach the gospel, I forgive my neighbour… so Lord, You\\nhave to hear me.” That is spiritual pride and God resists the proud (1st Peter\\n5:5). If anyone owes the other anything, you are the one that owes Him. Tell\\nHim “Lord, please have mercy on me in this area where I need Your\\nintervention. Remember my dedication to your Kingdom and please have mercy on\\nme. “When you pray thus, He responds quickly. David was a man after God’s\\nheart because he always came humbly before Him. Despite his achievements and\\nfeats for God, he never boasted in His presence. He always came seeking mercy.\\nThat is the kind of man that God can call “A man after my heart.” You may have\\ndone many great and mighty things for God; remember Moses. Even after all he\\nhad done for God, he still did not get to the promised land. It is only those\\nwho remain babies in the hands of God who can reach the promised land of\\nHeaven. In Matthew 5:3, Jesus said: Blessed are the poor in Spirit: for theirs\\nis the kingdom of heaven.”Are you humble or proud in spirit? Written by Pastor\\nE.A. Adeboye.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': '*Spare the rod and spoil the child.*Beating a child doesn\\'t sometimes solve an issue or deter a child from doing the wrong things or repenting from wrongdoings, sometimes sitting a child down and telling him or her advantages and disadvantages of a particular issue , behavior or manner can help that child. Parents have great roles in shaping the life of their children, in doing this, what steps do you think you can take ?, how will you like your children to view you?, Do you want to become an Undertaker or John Cena to your children ? or do wish your children wouldn\\'t eat until they see their mum and dad ?. These are the things we need to think about in adopting measures in teaching our children. The Bible says *\"spare the rod and spoil the child\"*, but this does not give us an excuse to go extreme with our kids, some parents go as far as starving them because of something wrong they did. When I was growing up, there was a neighbor next to where we lived, she was temperamental, anything her child does will give her an excuse to beat or rain curses on this child, because of this temper, she fights with everyone and pour the blame on her daughter, saying it\\'s because her daughter goes to the other person\\'s house that\\'s why that was happening.As a child grows, sometimes parents say they start to grow wings because they have reached their adolescent stage, children might become uncooperative sometimes due to pressure from peers, children don\\'t see their parents fit enough to correct them again , problems might arise from this if proper education and handling is not employed , it might lead to the destruction of the child\\'s life and also the parents. The Bible says we should teach our children the word of God so that they would not depart from it even in their old age. As parents we must ensure we teach our children the way of the lord, an example is Samuel, he lived most of his life in the temple where he was constantly thought the word of God. Joseph in the Bible was sold by his brothers at a small age but he did not depart from the teachings of the lord, bible recorded he was closest to his father, he went on to become a great leader in a foreign land. Joseph and Mary constantly took Jesus to the synagogue to learn the word of God. These people at their young age had been taught the word of God and this helped them throughout their lives.Questions we need to start asking ourselves is , Are we teaching our children the word of God?, or we just go with the current of life. Love should be the basis of our relationship with our children, the Bible even tells us not to provoke our children to wrath , but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.#northreturnee\\n\\n',\n",

It is the works\\nof your hand that God blesses.People are in farms planting yams and you are\\nbusy sitting in church. When it is harvesting time, don’t expect yams to fall\\nfrom heaven. When it is eating time, people are eating and you are “believing”\\nGod for yams. Faith doesn’t work that way!Faith without work is dead. There\\nshould be a corresponding action in line with faith.When the Christian gospel\\ncame to Africa, the missionaries saw two vital areas of deficiencies –\\nhospitals and schools. They filled these gaps. Today, directly or indirectly,\\nwe have all benefited from it.Today, we have a major problem – unemployment.\\nInstead of filling this gap, we are taking advantage of it.We gather the\\nunemployed and “prophesy” jobs to them. We give them stickers, sell “holy\\nwater”, tell them to sow and expect a harvest convincing their gullible mind\\nto “work” for the Lord and that breakthrough is coming… All these we do to\\nmanipulate and exploit the vulnerable.We travel abroad. We have gone to Isreal\\nand seen the agricultural exploits there. But we are not willing to bring them\\nhome.When we sow, instead of our money to be invested into ventures like\\nagriculture that would alleviate the sufferings of the weak ones among us, we\\nchannel the money to an atheist in Germany who designed MOG’s customized\\ncar.We channel the money to Buddhists in China, where we buy our building\\nmaterials. We direct the money to a gay in America who produced the sound\\nsystem and lighting system.We channel the money to a Muslim in Dubai who did\\nthe interior decoration of our “magnificent” church building…what a Capital\\nFlight!Why are we crying of poverty and for a breakthrough? The God that I\\nknow responds to work wherever he sees man doing something to advance\\nhumanity, be it a Hindu, Gay, Buddhist, atheist etc.I don’t want to start\\nmentioning names, neither do I want to indict any person. But just imagine\\nLiving Faith Church going into rice production, RCCG going into cassava\\nproduction, Foursquare into pepper & tomato, Christ Embassy into maize, Lord’s\\nChosen into yams, Catholics into millets, MFM going into plantain, etc. What\\nwill become of this great nation?The land is there. The manpower is there. The\\nmoney is there. Like the missionaries, who saw a problem and filled it, we can\\nalso fix this problem of unemployment and food security.Just imagine a church\\nsending hundreds of trailer loads of food to evangelize the North. No man can\\nresist love. Feed them in love and watch how their hearts change. That was how\\nthe missionaries changed the hearts of our forebears.The missionaries have\\ntried for us, and instead of us to keep pressing northwards, we have resorted\\nto building empires. We have commercialized the gospel. It is all about\\nbreakthroughs, money and less of Jesus, His Person, His Sacrifice and finished\\nworks.We have the manpower to feed Nigeria and Africa, generate employment by\\nadding values to farm produce and exporting them.It is time we convert our\\nexotic cars in our garages to tractors and other mechanized and modern\\nagricultural tools. By doing what the government cannot do, “THE GOVERNMENT\\nSHALL BE UPON ITS SHOULDER”.When we roar, the government is supposed to\\nquiver, not because of our large bank accounts, but because of our\\nintimidating exploits.It is time to wake up… I see a day when we shall be\\nholding our numerous church services in farms and factories. It is time to\\ntake the government upon its shoulder. It is action time!Scene at typical\\nPentecostal church in Nigeria with thousands of congregants who routinely\\nthrong the arena with their tithes and, of course, great anticipation for\\nmiraculous cure or access to wealth.The Voice of One has spoken!

To bring these exciting offerings within the reach of every\\nNigerian, the pay-TV entertainment provider said it pioneered and remains the\\nonly player in the Nigerian market offering flexible subscription options –\\ndaily, weekly, monthly and quarterly, allowing Nigerians to subscribe\\naccording to their needs and means. Disclosing this during a virtual\\nconference meeting with journalists, on Friday, in Lagos, Viki Liu, Marketing\\nManager of StarTimes said that due to StarTimes\\' giant stride to make digital\\nTV affordable to all families, the price of pay-TV has been greatly lowered,\\nfrom average $50 per month to 3 or 5 dollars per month.She noted that the pay-\\nas-you-go options are available for all bouquets; and whether a customer\\nsubscribes daily, weekly or monthly to a bouquet, he will have access to the\\nsame channels and services, adding that flexible billing systems are\\nreasonable for people who do not spend reasonable time watching television\\nafter subscription.Viki said that although the sharp drop in naira has forced\\nthe brand to adjust some of its bouquet prices upwards from August 1,\\nsubscribers will get more value for what they are paying, without compromising\\naffordability. Her words, \"Over the last couple of months, StarTimes has been\\nadding new and exciting channels, great local and international channels for\\nthe viewing pleasure of our teeming subscribers without an additional charge.\\nThese channels, including other existing flagship channels and content, were\\nacquired at a cost which StarTimes has continued to bear to cushion the\\neconomic pressure on subscribers.\"“For sports lovers, StarTimes offers\\nvarieties of international football tournaments for the entertainment of our\\nteeming subscribers. Europa League, Bundesliga and Coppa Italia are exclusive\\non StarTimes. We also air English FA Cup, Copa Del Rey among others. “We also\\nbrought back FOX; FOX LIFE; National Geographic; Nat Geo Wild; ESPN; ESPN 2\\nand BABY TV. We will very soon also be including a new Hollywood blockbuster\\nmovie channel on our list of entertainment content,” she also noted. Speaking\\non the challenges that the company is facing in its quest to provide cable TV\\nentertainment to subscribers, the StarTimes marketing manager said that\\nearlier this year, the Federal Government increased the rate of the Value\\nAdded Tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5%. “This increase did have an effect on our cost\\nbut in consideration of our customers’ plight, we continued to bear that extra\\ncost.\"More recently, the impact of the foreign exchange rate has had an\\noverwhelming adverse effect on our business. Our business is not exempted from\\nthe effect of the naira depreciation affecting all businesses in the\\ncountry.“All of our foreign content is bought in dollars and to continually\\nserve our subscribers the best content, we have been constrained to make some\\nslight review on our subscription rates. The decision to make this review is\\nbased on compelling external factors beyond our control. “By this review which\\nwill take effect from August 1st, for our DTT (antenna) users: basic bouquet\\nsubscribers will now pay N1,700 as against N1300 monthly to enjoy close to 80\\nexciting channels; Classic Bouquet subscribers will pay N2,500 as against\\nN1,900 monthly to keep enjoying close to 100 channels. While Nova bouquet\\nremains unchanged at N900 with over 43 exciting channels. “For DTH (Dish)\\nusers: Smart bouquet subscribers will pay N2,200 as against N1,900 monthly;\\nSuper Bouquet subscribers will pay N4,200 as against N3,800 monthly. While\\nNova bouquet remains unchanged at N900. DTH has close to 200 exciting\\nchannels.“We hope our customers understand as we are not known for incessant\\nprice increase. Rather, StarTimes’ subscription prices had on different\\noccasions been reduced in order to make digital TV affordable for every\\nNigerian.”Responding to enquiries from the media, Liu assured subscribers that\\nas a business, the brand will continue to make it a priority to broaden its\\ncontent offerings to meet a variety of their interests without compromising\\naffordability. “Despite the price adjustment, we shall continue to delight our\\nsubscribers with more value at the best cost in the Pay-TV market. Consumer’s\\ninterests are duly taken care of with these flexible subscription options\\nwhich give them access to pay for what they watch as low as N90 daily.” she\\nsaid.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Okay people,I know similar threads like this have been discussed and trashed\\nearlier and some months back, i actually hijacked a thread and asked some\\nquestions for which no one had any reasonable answer except sentiments,\\nchildish off key comments and of course, the usual bible quotations which more\\nthan a few people claim to be \"proof\".I beg to differ.Here are a few of those\\nquestions again :(1)According to the history of the bible (from Adam till the\\npresent day), the world is not older than 5000 years and yet, there are\\narchaeological findings dating back to millions and even billions of years\\nback.There is no mention of ancient civilizations, dinosaurs or prehistoric\\nplant life.All that was mentioned are what we see around us today.Could you\\nexplain this discrepancy?(2)In the book of Genesis, Cain killed Abel out of\\njealousy.He was exiled from Eden and he went to the land of Nod and married\\nthere.Can you explain who those people were coz from my recollection, at that\\ntime it was just Adam,Eve and two kids.So who are these people that were\\n\"omitted\" in the story and who is this mysterious woman Cain married? Was it\\nhis sister? Or did he get married to animals?(3)In the same bible, the lord\\nwas angry with the world he created and was determined to destroy his creation\\n(how ironic ).He instructed Noah to build an arc and put pairs of all living\\nthings in that ark.To the best of my knowledge, botanists spend their entire\\nlives collecting and identifying species of a particular\\norganism/animal/plant.Even if he lived 2,000 years on earth, there was no way\\nhe could have been able to achieve such a feat coz there were no\\nairplanes,buses or ships to travel across the globe to get all pairs of\\norganisms.Are we trying to say he came down to Africa to get the African\\nelephant and then trekked back to India to get the Indian elephant? Think\\nabout it and you\\'ll see how ridiculous it sounds.No roads.No buses.No\\nplanes.No ships.No rockets.No internet and yet. . . (4)The current bible used\\nin Christianity today has two parts. . .the old and new testament.Now there\\nare practices in the old testament that most churches especially Pentecostals\\nhave discontinued e.g eye for an eye, sacrificial offerings and so on.When you\\nask them, they tell you that Christ came and all things are washed away\\nrendering the old testament null and void.If this is true, why then do they\\nstill revert to Malachi 3:10 when it comes to psyching up the congregation to\\ngive more offerings and tithes? Weren\\'t all things of old washed away? The\\nsame people will tell you that no part of the bible is irrelevant and the same\\npeople choose the parts that suit them.Are they confused about who and what\\nthey are worshiping?Do they even have an idea of what they are doing?(5)The\\ngod in the bible is referred to as the all knowing god. . .the omni potent,\\nomni present and all that. If he is all these, then he should have known that\\nEve would be tempted by the serpent and she would fall.He should have known\\nhow his creation would go till this present day.Why then did he create man\\nwhen he knew that failure was imminent? The bible says he destroyed the world\\nonce and will do it again (some call it rapture, others call it Armageddon, a\\nfew think it\\'s both ways). Why create something and condemn it? Is the bible\\nimplying that god is confused? That he makes errors? Isn\\'t he supposed to be\\nthe all knowing god? Explain this please.(6)The people who brought us\\nChristianity also brought guns,liquor and slave trade (i don\\'t know about you\\nbut that doesn\\'t sound \"holy-like\" to me).They superimposed their religion on\\nthe black folks as a means of control.The same people who brought us their\\nreligion don\\'t take it as serious as we do.I might be wrong but Nigeria to the\\nbest of my knowledge is the most prayerful/religious country in the world\\n(there is hardly any street in Lagos without at least 2 churches or\\nfellowships) and yet, with all the abundance of religion, we are the most cold\\nhearted people to our fellow human beings! Christianity as we know it today\\noriginated from the Catholic church whose practices are chiefly unorthodox or\\nin plain English. . .idol worship (how else can you explain worshiping a\\ngraven image of Mary, praying to saints,kissing the rings and feet of priests\\nand the rosary. . .all of which aren\\'t mentioned in the bible). Christians all\\nclaim to be worshiping one god. . .why then can\\'t a Christ Embassy worshiper\\nspend a few Sundays at Celestial Church of Christ? Why can\\'t a C.A.C Pastor\\nminister in Assemblies of God? Why can\\'t Winners Chapel members worship in\\nK&S;? Or are there different gods? Are the so called Christians confused?\\nPlease explain these few questions satisfactorily and i\\'ll hold my peace.NB :\\nPlease, don\\'t give me the usual \"god works in mysterious ways\" or \" the ways\\nof the lord cannot be understood\" or \" do not question the lord\" crap.I\\'ve\\nheard it one time too many.\\n\\n',\n",

Studying the Word(Bible): note that I wrote\\nstudying, and not reading, there's a big difference between them, in Studying\\nthe word— you will have to bring your whole attention and focus to what you\\nare reading.Studying the word is important because it's only through it that\\nyou will get to know more about God—his love, ways, what pleases him, and what\\ndispleases him. If you want to get closer to God, you must know his ways by\\nstudying his Word.2). Doing The Word: Now of what use is it if you don't\\npractice what you learn?, The Word is power, but when you fail to act it\\nout—it becomes a mere knowledge.Do/act the Word, and you will see God move in\\nyour life. So when you study the Word — do what it says.3). Prayer: prayer is\\na form of communication with God, it means talking with God, hanging out with\\nhim—spending time with him. You need to talk to God if you wants to get closer\\nto him, because every relationship without communication can not stand\\nfirm.Communication is the key. Praying is not always about begging God for\\nsomething, it's a time of praise, worship, thanksgivings, adoration... So next\\ntime you are praying, talk to God like his friend — and not a begger. let most\\nof your prayers be about praise, thanksgivings, adoration...(e.t.c)...Thanks\\nfor reading.

              "  'content': 'In the beginning, God instituted marriage as the perfect solution to the\\nproblems of a lonely man who needed a companion and help meet to fulfil the\\nGenesis 1:28 divine mandate to “… Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the\\nearth, and subdue it.” Having proffered a perfect and permanent solution to\\nthe human need for companionship and support, God warned us against separation\\nor divorce in Matthew 19:6 by saying:“Wherefore they are no more twain, but\\none flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put\\nasunder.”The Bible does not imply that the man and woman will become\\nphysically merged, but that through the marriage covenant they become\\nspiritually bound as one – united in love, faith, Spirit and purpose. That is\\nway marriage comes with grave implications for those who become unequally\\nyoked with unbelievers, or those who get bound to the wrong partners. Such\\ncases often lead to crises, instability and unfulfilled destiny. Nevertheless,\\nGod frowns at any form of separation or divorce; rather, He is particularly\\ninterested in upholding the sanctity of marriage. I pray for anyone going\\nthrough a marital crisis: The Prince of peace will intervene in your marriage\\ntoday, in the mighty name of Jesus.God hates divorce and He states this\\nclearly in Malachi 2:16. He further states in 1st Corinthians 7:10-11 that:\\n“….Let not the wife depart from her husband: But and if she departs, let her\\nremain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put\\naway his wife.” In God’s plan, only death can nullify the marriage covenant,\\nas explained in Romans 7:2-3.All Christians must thus ensure they uphold the\\nsanctity of marriage through love, humanity and peaceful co-existence with\\neach other (Ephesians 4:1-3).Written by Pastor E.A. Adeboye.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': \"[b][/b]Matthew stuck the third stick into his mouth. He smiled while doing\\nthis because I had always reminded him that smokers are liable to die young.\\nAnyway, he got on with his story. “I was in the hospital bed for three months.\\nIt all started with one usual decision. It seemed initially like a good\\ndecision but it ended a ludicrous one. That tragic Sunday morning, I got a\\nphone call from Jason. He told me a couple of friends had arranged to have a\\ncar race at a particular location. I was getting ready for Sunday service when\\nthis call came in. I wanted to know why it could not wait for the evening but\\nJason ended up convincing me why it had to hold that morning. It became a\\nchoice between playing the piano at the church and going for fun; I was the\\npianist for the church choir. I thought about the fun we would have and more\\nabout the fact that Sheila was going to be there too. I dropped the idea of\\nSunday service and went for the car key. That was the last time I felt the\\nusual warmth of the house and my room for the next three months. The crash\\ntook the lives of three of my friends but I was lucky to have survived; even\\nthough sadly because I would have preferred dying along with Sheila and the\\nother two. The accident left me in a condition that would have crippled me for\\nthe rest of my life. While being hospitalized and going through excruciating\\npains, I overheard the doctor telling my mother several times that I had very\\nslim chances of using my limbs again. Anyway, the doctor had these private\\nconversations with my mother without knowing that I was paying attention to\\ntheir discussions.” The smoke from his mouth engulfed the little space between\\nus. “I wasn't told much but my mother’s gloomy face after each private\\ndiscussion with the doctor during ward rounds revealed all the hidden\\nmessages. Those moods created a sordid atmosphere of despondency in that\\ncorner where I holed up seeking for answers. My body needed something positive\\nbut my mother and I weren't in the right frame of mind to provide the\\nnecessary vibes that could have provided that positivity. I noticed that my\\nbody and soul were collapsing in bits. Incidentally, it would take one visit\\nby an unexpected relative to change everything- my maternal uncle walked into\\nthe hospital to see me. That was his first visit since the accident happened.\\nI was glad to see him because he was an embodiment of wisdom and he had this\\nsolid sense of humour. He lived as if there were no problems in his life. You\\ncan understand why I felt relieved seeing him by my bedside. He was with us\\nonly for an hour but I smiled and giggled all through. When it was time for\\nhim to leave, he came by the bedside and said,“That you made it till this day\\nhas shown that God is willing to give you a second chance. I do not want to\\nknow what the medical report said but I am sure that I have a fighter in you.\\nDon't let whatever is willing to take those limbs to win. They are yours-\\nfight to keep them. That reminds me. I got a new piano for you. They said it\\nwas the latest model and I can't wait for you to return home and give us some\\nbeautiful rendition”Matthew was done with smoking and I was glad. He\\ncontinued, “After uncle Dave left, I noticed this vigour and inner strength\\nurging me to get up and walk out of the hospital with my two legs intact.\\nInitially, I was resigned to whatever fate threw at me but after that\\nremarkable visit, I felt a spark of life run through me. I got myself in\\nattack mode and started pushing from all cylinders. My body and soul started\\nworking as a team, with recovery being the only thing on my mind; and gaining\\nback what was taken from them. Even the doctor and my mother noticed the new\\nchanges. One Saturday morning, the whole ward went into a frenzy- I moved my\\nlimbs for the first time in three months. My mother sang and hummed under her\\nbreath all through the night. My recovery was astonishingly speedy and the\\nphysiotherapist confessed that he never saw anything like that. I was there\\nfor another three months before I finally walked out of the hospital with my\\nlegs and arms perfectly working all to the glory of God.”He emptied the glass\\nof beer on the table and concluded. “I got home and could only manage to wait\\nfor two weeks to get my new piano from Uncle Dave. It was then that Uncle Dave\\nreleased the bombshell- there was never a piano. He told me that my recovery\\nrate worried him. He saw that I was fading away and appeared ready to succumb\\nto the fight. The piano which he already knew I loved playing became the bait\\nto lure me back to the ring so I could fight like the warrior they all knew.\\nIt was at this point that I made that connection to the miracle that happened.\\nThat fightback was to recover so that I could have my new piano. That was the\\nday I added uncle Dave to the list of people that I was going to be indebted\\nto all my life. Sadly enough, he died a few years after this\\nincident.”REFLECTIONNo one can ever be useless in life by helping people find\\ntheir way. There are many sources through which one can receive or offer\\ninspiration. In other words, you do not need money to inspire people. I was\\ntold by Matthew that he later got a piano from the physiotherapist who was\\nastonished by his recovery; the trick by uncle Dave inspired him too. He\\nbought the piano for him when he realized that his uncle couldn't do it. For\\nmore:https://anekearinzeblog.com\\n\\n\",\n",

While I respect the office and authority they hold and believe\\nthey are the custodian of the holy place, they are men of God, with emphasis\\non men. It has become evident that these men of God are respected in our\\npresent society than the idea of the omnipresent God. We hide our evil deeds\\nfrom our pastor with less thought that the God we worship sees all. This\\nhypocrisy baffled me, especially with the ardent religious worshippers. And\\nthis tells a lot about their understanding of the Bible. They seem to want to\\nplease these men rather than God. However, if we understand the word of God,\\nwe will realize that our relationship with God is more important than these\\ncustodians. Mind you, I am not undermining their importance but stating the\\nmost critical part of being religious. Let's look at what entails a true man\\nof God:A good custodian of God will direct you into a path to be close to God\\nand not man. A true man of God will not want you to be dependent on his word\\nor mouth feeding you always. A true custodian will teach you the word so that\\nyou will become independent. He will be a guide and not a controller of your\\nlife affairs. While the custodian should teach you to hate sin, you should\\nalso learn to love sinners. With a true custodian of the Bible, you will get\\nto understand that the word is free. You do not pay or attend a fancy church\\nto get it. The points above are missing in our modern-day religion center.\\nThese pastors do not want you to be independent with the word of God. They\\nproffer all kinds of methods and doctrine to keep you dependent on them, such\\nas the fear of witchcraft, the promises of wealth, the promises that all will\\nbe well, and lots more as long as you are kept under their control. But the\\ntrue price of the Word of God is salvation, peace, and freedom regardless of\\nthe situation you find yourself. Even Jesus went through a lot in his short\\nlife on earth, so why will you believe one pastor will take away all your\\nproblem in this world. God promises to be with us through our tribulations and\\nto guide us through his word. Begin to seek God's world from a different\\nperspective, trying to get closer to Him rather than your pastor and watch\\nyour life begin to blossom, as you find peace in a troubling\\nworld.https://livingdfaith..com/2020/07/build-relationship-with-god-and-\\nnot.html?m=1\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': \"Please exercise patients to read this.There's a huge error being taught and\\npracticed today in churches concerning speaking in tongues. It has become so\\nbad that people have become so comfortable in the error that they don't want\\nto listen to the Bible when used to correct them.This is what is practice as\\nspeaking in churches today: eskobibikilaka Shaka raka reke shamba. Iskala\\nmoranta manaksa manbi. Amba raka reke maneka shaka raka.Nothing said above\\nmakes sense. It even sounds like a demonic spell from a Harry Potter movie.\\nYet those who say such usually say they are speaking in tongues.Let's examine\\nthe first time speaking in tongues was recorded in the New Testament.Acts\\n2:1-4 KJV1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with\\none accord in one place.2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a\\nrushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.3 And\\nthere appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each\\nof them.4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak\\nwith other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.As seen above, when the\\ndisciples of Jesus spoke in tongues, the Bible said it was with other tongues\\nwhich means other languages. Why would the Holy Spirit make them speak in\\nstrange languages? Is it for a show off or what?The next verse shows that many\\npeople came from every nation from under the heaven to Jerusalem that day. 5\\nAnd there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation\\nunder heaven.Obviously, these people spoke their own native languages. In\\nother for the disciples to be able to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to\\nthem into salvation, the Holy Spirit gave the disciples the ability to speak\\nin other tongues. The disciples were enabled to speak the language and of the\\ndifferent nations present in Jerusalem on that day.6 Now when this was noised\\nabroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every\\nman heard them speak in his own language.Did you see the bolded part above\\nwhich says every man heard the disciples speak in his own language? This shows\\nthat the disciples were not saying gibberish that no man could understand.\\nRead further because the Bible even listed the countries whose languages the\\ndisciples spoke on that day.Acts 2:7-117 And they were all amazed and\\nmarvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak\\nGalilaeans?8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were\\nborn?9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,\\nand in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia,\\nin Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews\\nand proselytes,11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues\\nthe wonderful works of God.Now, there are some Bible verses which people use\\nto deceive others and themselves into speaking gibberish which they call\\nspeaking in tongues. Let's examine those verses and see how they have been\\nused wrongly.1 Corinthians 14:1 KJVFollow after charity, and desire spiritual\\ngifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.As seen above, Apostle Paul stated that\\nit is good to desire the spiritual gifts but better to desire the ability to\\nprophesy i.e to preach. This has been mistaken to mean one has to desire to be\\nable to speak in tongues aka gibberish. Let's read the next verse which is the\\nkiller verse those who love to speak gibberish often quote to defend their\\nways.2 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but\\nunto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh\\nmysteries.You see, when those who speak gibberish and jargons do so, they say\\nit is not for man to understand because they are speaking into God in the\\nspirit. An untrained eye or someone who doesn't have the spirit of God will be\\nfooled by the way they interpret this verse.Now, Paul spoke of two things int\\nthat chapter: The first is speaking in tongues and the second prophesying aka\\npreaching/teaching.Now, when he says speaking in an unknown tongue, he stated\\nthat no man understands that tongue. But when he speaks of prophesying, he\\nsays the church understands it. This must mean that the prophesying/preaching\\nis done in a language everyone present at the gathering understands. That's\\nwhy he says the people are edified by it.3 But he that prophesieth speaketh\\nunto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.Next is the verse that\\ndestroys the falsehood called speaking in gibberish.4 He that speaketh in an\\nunknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the\\nchurch.As seen above, the man who speaks in an unknown tongue edified himself.\\nThe dictionary meaning of Edify is to instruct or improve (someone) morally or\\nintellectually. So, how can someone speaking gibberish claim he's edifying\\nhimself when he doesn't understand a word he's saying to be able to instruct\\nhimself morally or intellectually? Yet, they quote the below verse to fool\\nthemselves into thinking only God should understand their gibberish.2 For he\\nthat speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no\\nman understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.No, Paul is\\nsaying that just as the preacher edified the church with a language the\\ncongregation can understand, so is the man who speaks in the language he\\nunderstands edifies himself with but can't edify the church with it.b]4[/b] He\\nthat speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth\\nedifieth the church.Paul further stated that if you have the ability to speak\\nin foreign languages, it would be of no benefit to the congregation who can't\\nunderstand the languages. Such a person can only speak the language if there\\nis someone who can interpret it to the congregation.5 I would that ye all\\nspake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that\\nprophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the\\nchurch may receive edifying.Now, show me who can interpret the gibberish\\nspoken today as tongues . Once the person steps forward, tell him to tell you\\nthe name of the language just as the Bible told us the names of the languages\\nspoken by the disciples who spoke in tongues.Why did Paul advise Christians to\\ndesire the ability to preach more than the ability to speak a foreign\\nlanguage? He says speaking a foreign language to someone who doesn't\\nunderstand it is like a waste of time. But if you can preach, you will be able\\nto teach and win souls.6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with\\ntongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by\\nrevelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?Paul went on to\\neven use musical instruments to explain his point. Imagine soldiers fighting\\nBoko Haram in camp and awaiting the next battle. To ensure they prepare for\\nbattle, a trumpet is blown in a distinctive way. That alerts the soldiers that\\nit's time to do battle. Now imagine the trumpet is blown like jazz music to\\nalert the soldiers that Boko Haram is coming, do you think they will\\nunderstand? 7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp,\\nexcept they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is\\npiped or harped?8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall\\nprepare himself to the battle?To further bust the lies that speaking gibberish\\nis speaking to God, Paul said if you speak words that are not understood, you\\nare simply speaking into the air, not to God.9 So likewise ye, except ye utter\\nby the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is\\nspoken? for ye shall speak into the air.He added that every voice has\\nsignification.10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world,\\nand none of them is without signification.Again, why did Paul advise\\nChristians to learn to preach instead of speaking in a foreign language? He\\nsaid speaking a foreign language to people who don't understand it will make\\nyou appear a barbarian.11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I\\nshall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a\\nbarbarian unto me.12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual\\ngifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.I know we\\nsometimes sing Christian songs in languages we don't understand. But most\\ntimes, we are told the meaning of the song and this makes us glad.Likewise,\\nimagine someone teaches you to say a good prayer in French, a language you\\ndon't understand. When you say that prayer, your spirit prays it and God\\nunderstands, but you don't and it will be unfruitful to you. That's why it is\\nbest to pray in a language you understand.13 Wherefore let him that speaketh\\nin an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.14 For if I pray in an unknown\\ntongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.15 What is it\\nthen? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding\\nalso: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding\\nalso.Paul also stated that praying in an unknown tongue to the congregation\\nwill not get any response from them. They won't know what you are saying for\\nthem to say amen to, they won't be edified by the prayer.16 Else when thou\\nshalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the\\nunlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what\\nthou sayest?17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not\\nedified.The way these gibberish speakers interpret the next verse makes me\\nlaugh 18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:What they say\\nis that Apostle Paul can speak gibberish more than everyone else. If it is\\nreally gibberish Paul spoke, then he lied to have said he does it better than\\neveryone else. Let me battle their type of Apostle Paul.Paul speaks in\\ntongues: sikabhd akhakd mobanda nahuyri.Yours truly speaks in tongues:\\njugataman husgeke raka shege shagu.I may not have done it exactly how their\\nPaul did it. Guess what? He can't do it how I did too. . Yet they say he\\nspeaks in gibberish more than everyone else.Well, the Apostle Paul of the\\nBible never spoke gibberish. What he spoke were human languages. Paul was an\\neducated man who learned under Gamaliel. Paul was also a widely traveled man\\nand must have learned the languages of the people of the places he traveled\\nto. How do you think he was able to set up churches in those strange\\nplaces?Yet, Paul would rather speak in a language the congregation can\\nunderstand instead of speak in a tongue they don't.19 Yet in the church I had\\nrather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach\\nothers also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.He went on to reveal\\nthat speaking in tongues are for a sign to unbelievers. Remember how those\\npeople in the Book of Acts chapter 2 were marveled when they heard the\\ndisciples of Jesus speak in different foreign language, their languages?22\\nWherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that\\nbelieve not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for\\nthem which believe.Why did Paul say prophesying is for them that believe?\\nBecause it is to edify them more about God and build their faith.Imagine you\\nenter a church where everyone is speaking in different languages.23 If\\ntherefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with\\ntongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they\\nnot say that ye are mad?Yet, people gather in churches to speak gibberish, not\\neven human languages.27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by\\ntwo, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.28 But\\nif there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him\\nspeak to himself, and to God.As seen in the second bold part above, when you\\nspeak in an unknown tongue, you speak to God and to yourself which means you\\nunderstand what you are saying. Next time you see someone saying gibberish,\\nask him for the name of the language he just spoke and the meaning. He will\\nlook at you as if he just saw a ghost.Any pastor praying with words no one\\nunderstands is either saying gibberish or saying demonic incantations or\\nspells. Flee from such.Thank you.\\n\\n\",\n",

Do not get addicted to alcohol and smoking to such an extent that\\nyou harm yourselves internally and externally. 7. Do not see any old woman as\\na witch even when ten herbalists and priests and Pastors have told you that\\nshe is a witch. For ideas are like waves, therefore the ideas and opinion that\\nshe is a witch could have been unconsciously passed from head to head around\\nthe time when you seek the help of such people. 8.

For many humans\\nhave died in their sleep when they dreamt of cats. Therefore do not involve\\nyour hearts in the dreams you have upon your bed. For the dream of seeing a\\ncat does not mean anything spiritual, therefore it should not be demonized.\\n11. Do not worry over what you do not have at the moment.

Do not save this in the bellies\\nof the priests or the pastors of sheep. But save it in the safe or in the bank\\nrather.

The downpour made it difficult\\nfor him to see so he missed a turn he was supposed to take.Driving in the\\nheavy rain on a deserted road, feeling hungry and tired, he frantically began\\nto look for any sign of civilization. He came across a small tattered house\\nand knocked on the door. A beautiful lady opened the door. He explained his\\nsituation and wanted to use the lady’s telephone but she had no telephone. She\\nhowever asked him to come inside and wait till the weather improved.The doctor\\nwho was hungry and exhausted accepted the offer. The lady offered him\\nsomething to eat and drink.

              "  'content': 'What difference does it make who Jesus is? He lived over 2,000 years ago, so\\nhow could that matter today? Mainly the truth is, knowing who Jesus is can\\nmold your character, impact your belief system, and change your lifestyle. And\\nmore than that, it will determine your eternal destiny.Let’s Explore Who Jesus\\nIsIn order to discover who Jesus is, we can begin by reading what is written\\nabout His birth. Seven hundred years before Christ was born, the prophet Micah\\nsaid that One would come out of Bethlehem whose beginnings were from eternity\\npast. (Micah 5:2) The Bible also teaches that Jesus was born of a virgin after\\nbeing conceived by the Holy Spirit, and angels sang to announce His arrival.\\nAll of this makes Him very exceptional.In Colossians 1:16, we read that “by\\nHim all things were created.” So Jesus did not originate at birth, but was\\npre-existent with the Father in heaven, and was born into the world He Himself\\nhad created.The Life of JesusNext, consider His life. He was raised in\\nNazareth and worked at His earthly father’s trade as a young man. Nonetheless\\nwhen He was only twelve, He discussed theology in the temple with the\\nreligious leaders of His day. (Luke 2:46-49) It is clear that at this point,\\nHe was now about His heavenly Father’s business. John the Baptist acknowledged\\nJesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world” (John 1:29),\\nand a voice from heaven confirmed, “This is My adored (beloved) Son, in whom I\\nam well-pleased” (Matthew 3:17).Video : Reckless Love by Bethel Music (Cory\\nAsbury) >https://dailycrosswalk.com/video-reckless-love-by-bethel-music-cory-\\nasbury/When it was time to launch His ministry, Jesus, filled with the Holy\\nSpirit, began preaching that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 4:17)\\nHe taught that, if a soldier says to go one mile with him, we should go two.\\nThus if someone slaps our cheek, we should offer the other cheek as well. The\\npeople had never heard such things, but more than that, they had never\\nexperienced teaching with this kind of authority-it was obvious He was no\\nordinary teacher.The Miracles of JesusThen there were the miracles. At Jesus’\\ncommand, the blind could see, the deaf could hear, and the paralyzed could\\nwalk. He healed all kinds of sickness and cast out demons. Thousands were fed\\nwith just a few loaves of bread and a handful of fish. He walked on water,\\ncalmed a raging sea, and even raised the dead. Yes, He was a miracle worker,\\nbut that wasn’t the reason He came. It was clear that He was sent from God,\\nand in reality, He was God in human flesh.The crowd flocked to Him, eager for\\nHis touch. Many loved Him and believed in Him. But not everyone did. Some were\\nindifferent, and others, including the religious leaders, despised Him.\\nAlthough His was a life of absolute sinless perfection, there were those who\\nsought to destroy Him. Today, many people still choose not to believe in Him.\\nWhen I come across someone who says, “I don’t believe all this about Jesus,” I\\nlike to ask, “Whatever is it about Him you don’t believe?Whatever He was\\ndoing, Jesus was both God and man at the same time.One of the best ways to\\nunderstand someone is to find out what he thinks about himself. Jesus said\\nmany, many things about who He was-He said that He is the Son of God (Matthew\\n16:16-17), that He and the Father are one (John 10:30), and that the Father is\\nthe One who sent Him. (John 5:37) He also announced that He did not come to be\\nserved, but to serve and that He came to give His life as a ransom for\\nmany.statements from the book of John reveal that He claimed to be the Good\\nShepherd who loves the sheep (10:11), the Bread of Life who can prevent hunger\\n(6:48), and the True Vine who abides in us as we abide in Him. (15:1)Jesus,\\nthe Door to HeavenJesus also said He was the Door to Heaven (John 10:9), and\\nin John 14:6, He expanded on that thought: “I am the way, and the truth, and\\nthe life; Nobody comes to the Father but though Me.” That statement has caused\\nmany people to back away, thinking, What a bigoted, egotistical statement!\\nImagine how narrow-minded to think that the only way to Heaven is through the\\nperson of Jesus Christ. Still, this man called Jesus is exactly who He says He\\nis. He is the Good Shepherd. He is the Bread of Life. He’s the way, the truth,\\nand the very life itself. Since, you see, in order for us to have eternal\\nlife, we must receive Jesus Christ as our personal Savior.Also Read: Can Faith\\nReally Move Mountains?At the moment, if you believe all the other things Jesus\\nsaid, but decide He can’t be the only way to Heaven, then you are saying He\\ntold partial truths or lies. You can’t have it both ways. Either Jesus is who\\nHe says He is, or He is not. You can’t say, “Jesus is a good man, a wonderful\\nteacher, an effective preacher, a great healer, philosopher, and humanitarian,\\nBUT…” Whenever your belief in Christ’s validity has caveats, you make Him a\\nliar. When it comes to all that He said about Himself, either He is a\\ncounterfeit and a fraud, or He is exactly who He says He is God’s Eternal\\nLiving Son, the Savior of the world, and the One who will someday judge each\\none of us.The Death of JesusYes of course, to find out who Jesus really is, we\\nhave to look at His death. Looking at biblical accounts, it is obvious this\\nwas no ordinary death.Christ’s crucifixion was plotted by the religious\\nleaders-the same men who had exaggerated the requirements of the Mosaic law\\nand then coerced the people to obey in minute, burdensome detail. The same men\\nwere jealous of Jesus because their position of authority was threatened by\\nHis popularity with the crowds.So, in spite of the fact that they enforced the\\nLaw with others, these men were so ungodly that they were willing to lay aside\\none of the most basic principles in Scripture: “You shall not murder” ( Exodus\\n20:13). These individuals were committed and determined, at all cost, to kill\\nthis man Jesus. They felt so threatened by Him that they were totally blinded\\nto the truth of who He was.The death of Jesus was plotted by those who hated\\nHim. And it was performed by Roman soldiers, a group that had no earthly idea\\nwhat they were doing. They crucified two thieves, between whom they crucified\\nthe living God, clothed in human flesh, the sinless One born of a virgin, who\\nbegan His ministry in the power of the Holy Spirit.He never harmed anyone. He\\nnever rebelled against the government. He never violated the law. It’s a death\\nHe in no way deserved, and therefore, it looked like a vicious plot and a\\ntragedy. But remember what Jesus said?-that He came to do His father’s will\\nand to give His life as a ransom for many.So why was He dying? Because,\\ntogether with the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, God the Father had\\nplanned His death before the world ever began, knowing that man would sin\\nagainst Him and be hopeless and helpless to save himself.On the cross, it was\\nnot simply a man dying; it was an awesome, eternal scene in which God the\\nFather placed upon His Son the sin-debt of all mankind, past, present, and\\nfuture. And God unleashed the full force of His wrath to punish Jesus-instead\\nof you and me.Here is one more aspect to investigate if we really want to know\\nwho the man Jesus Christ is-we have to go beyond His death. This is not\\npossible to do with anyone else, of course, but because Jesus is the Son of\\nGod and the living God, He did exactly what He had promised: He rose from the\\ndead.Even His disciples were shocked, though He had told them ahead of time.\\nThrough His resurrection, Jesus settled once and for all that there is life\\nafter death, not just for Himself, but for all who believe on Him. Jesus\\nChrist’s resurrection also proves that everything He ever said is true.Jesus\\nsaid He is coming back. Can we believe that? Affirmative, because the Bible\\nsays so, and also because all the other promises Jesus made that could\\npossibly be fulfilled in His lifetime came to pass exactly as He had\\nsaid.Knowing the truth of who Jesus is means you are confronted with a\\ndecision: Will you believe the testimony of the Scriptures and receive Him? Or\\nwill you turn your back on truth and walk away to face a hopeless\\neternity?Next time you see a manger scene, remember who’s lying there-His\\nlife, His death, His words about Himself, and His resurrection. He is not just\\na baby; He the Son of God, sitting at the Father’s right hand, with all the\\nsovereign power of the universe, and with the offer of eternal life to anyone\\nwho believes on Him.Source:>>https://dailycrosswalk.com/who-is-jesus-christ-a-\\nshort-biography/\\n\\n',\n",

They don’t\\nplant, harvest, or save food in barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them.\\nDon’t you know you are worth much more than they are? 27. You cannot add any\\ntime to your life by worrying about it. 28. “And why do you worry about\\nclothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow. They don’t\\nwork or make clothes for themselves. 29. But I tell you that even Solomon, the\\ngreat and rich king, was not dressed as beautifully as one of these flowers.\\n30. If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful, what do you think he\\nwill do for you? It’s just grass—one day it’s alive, and the next day someone\\nthrows it into a fire. But God cares enough to make it beautiful. Surely he\\nwill do much more for you. Your faith is so small! 31. “Don’t worry and say,\\n‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32.\\nThat’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t\\nworry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. 33.\\nWhat you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do.\\nThen he will give you all these other things you need. 34. So don’t worry\\nabout tomorrow. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Tomorrow will have its\\nown worries. you cannot be a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you don't\\nrepent of your sin and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. stop typing nonsense\\n\\n\",\n",

The new man is not\\nabout how good you preach, speak in tongues, how long you have being in the\\nchurch, or those things many so called believer brag about as evident among\\nbelievers of nowadays. Who is a new man?The new man is one who has encountered\\nChrist and therefore does not follow the traditions and customs of this world.\\nThe new man is that believer, who has no secret life, who is not moved by the\\nwind of human doctrines going on in this generation Christians.

SCRIPTURE: Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my\\nheart to fear thy name. Psalm 86:11THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: When you are dedicated\\nto God, your heart is not divided but united in the pursuit of God.It has been\\nestablished that understanding is key to outstanding performance in any\\nendeavour. When you understand why you should do something, doing it becomes\\neasy. In the same manner, knowing the purpose of dedication will greatly\\nenhance the lifestyle of dedication to God. One of the reasons for dedication\\nis that man was created by God and for God (Revelation 4:11). If we know that\\nwe did not create ourselves and that we are not meant to live for ourselves,\\nthen dedication becomes easy.Now, having seen the reason for our dedication to\\nGod, what, then does it mean to be dedicated to God? Dedication to God implies\\na whole-hearted pursuit of God. It is a heart that is united in the pursuit of\\nGod. One may ask, “Why a united heart?” It is because one’s heart can be\\ndivided. This is why Psalm 86:11 says, Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk\\nin thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.So, when you are dedicated to\\nGod, your heart is not divided but united in the pursuit of God. Dedication to\\nGod is not having a heart that follows the world in one part and follows God\\nin another. It is not having a heart whose part follows the devil and another\\npart follows God. It is not having a heart with a cocktail of worldly and\\nheavenly inclinations. Rather, dedication is having a united heart, a heart\\nunited in the pursuit of God. It is allowing every department of your heart to\\nbe united in the pursuit of God. It is not a heart that is divided or\\ndistracted by several activities, fantasies and fallacies of this world. It is\\nhaving a heart that beats and pants after the Presence of God like the heart\\nof David who said, As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my\\nsoul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when\\nshall I come and appear before God?”(Psalm 42:1-2).Beloved, refuse for your\\nheart to be divided in the pursuit of God. Pursue God with focus and unity of\\nheart. This is what it means to be dedicated to God. And that is what brings\\ndistractions in time and eternity. Remember this: When you are dedicated to\\nGod, your heart is not divided but united in the pursuit of God.

              "  'content': \"COVID-19 MIRACLE: TWO PHD LECTURERS TESTIFY TO CORONAVIRUS HEALING THROUGH TB\\nJOSHUA PRAYERS! The popular Nigerian cleric, T.B. Joshua, has released yet\\nanother video showing COVID-19 patients, who both introduced themselves as\\nUniversity Lecturers and PhD holders, claiming to have been healed through\\nprayers on his channel Emmanuel TV. Drs. Dickson and Courage Ndamsa appeared\\non the channel via video call bearing medical reports with positive results\\nfor COVID-19, the pandemic that has infected more than ten-million throughout\\nthe globe resulting in over 500,000 casualties. Accompanied by their two\\ndaughters, the lecturers at the University of Bamenda, Cameroon, explained\\nthey were currently “in isolation” and lamented about their symptoms which\\nincluded difficulty in breathing, debilitating weakness and general pains\\nthroughout their body. “The only reason that will make you to stop doubting is\\nto be able to forgive yourself.” one of T.B. Joshua’s ministers counselled the\\nfamily of four. “When you forgive yourself, you let go of offence.” The\\nminister began praying for the couple, making commands in the name of Jesus\\nChrist to which Dr. Courage began to behave peculiarly, shaking her head and\\ntwisting her body “uncontrollably”. “Who gave them this sickness?” the\\nminister shouted. “I gave it to her!” the academician replied, underlying\\ngraphics on Emmanuel TV asserting it was an ‘evil spirit’ who was speaking\\nthrough her. The minister continued, “Right now, you demon, you are leaving\\nthis body with all your incurable afflictions and sicknesses. Come out, in the\\nname of Jesus Christ!” Dr. Courage dropped to her knees and began vomiting\\nprofusely as the minister continually commanded the “demon” to come out before\\nfinally declaring her “free”. Her husband, Dr. Ndamsa and their two young\\ndaughters, were equally prayed for and declared free from the deadly virus.\\nProceeding the 'interactive prayer’ session, Drs. Dickson and Courage Ndamsa\\nreturned days later to the big screen of the Emmanuel TV Studios with new\\nmedical reports showing a negative diagnosis for COVID-19. “Jesus healed us.\\nThe miracle is beyond the understanding of man and science.” Dr. Ndamsa, who\\nlectures in Economics, exclaimed, further explaining the whole family went for\\na medical test the day after their ‘healing’. He advised large nations around\\nthe world to “look beyond science” and “carry God along” in their decisions,\\nplans and actions against the scourge of COVID-19. Dr. Courage described the\\n‘interactive prayer session’ as “a wonderful experience”. “At one point, I\\nfelt my hands started shaking. I tried to hold myself but before I knew it, my\\nbody was vibrating and that is the only thing I could remember,” she\\nrecollected. Both testified that all symptoms associated with the virus\\ndisappeared immediately after the prayers, prompting them to go for medical\\nverification of their healing. “God has given everyone plenty of evidence to\\nbelieve in Him. Remember, we treat; God heals. So, let us include God in our\\ndecisions. There is no fear, no panic. With God, all things are possible,” TB\\nJoshua commented on his social media handles in response to the ‘miracle’.\\nNews of COVID-19 healings amid T.B. Joshua’s prayer sessions even prompted a\\nresponse from the World Health Organization (WHO) after they were questioned\\nabout the miracle of a medical doctor who admitted Joshua’s prayers cured him.\\nWHO’s Executive Director of Health Emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, expressed\\nreadiness of the international health agencies to collaborate with bodies such\\nas The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) to advance the fight against\\nCOVID-19 whilst the Director General of WHO Dr. Ghebreyesus added that faith\\nand science should “go together”. Emmanuel TV’s YouTube videos have been\\nviewed over 600 million times and the channel has nearly 1.7 million\\nsubscribers.VIDEO -\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGaEgEhtl9chttps://trixxng.com/covid-19-miracle-\\ntwo-phd-lecturers-testify-to-coronavirus-healing-through-tb-joshua-prayers/\\n\\n\",\n",

Let us build a befitting church or the largest\\nchurch in the world is the new trend. But the church is actually the body of\\nChrist, the Christians. More emphasis is put on building the BUILDING than in\\nbuilding the temple. 3. Finally the Bible is not the book but the word.

              "  'content': 'Just like we have the word \"edutainment\" (means something educative and\\nentertaining at the same time), I\\'ve as well come up with this word \"chris-\\ntainment\" to mean a common Religious/Church Deceptive system of REDUCING godly\\nor Christian things to mere ENTERTAINMENTS.When preaching or evangelising:\\nacting, gospel music, man-made religious events (like XMAS, Easter, Vigil,\\nCrusades, etc); Bible study and the likes become more of catching FUN or for\\nPLEASURES, instead of Worshipping and Glorifying Jesus, is what I would like\\nto CALL the LIE of \"chris-tainment\" (as others like CHRIS-MAS, Christian Rock,\\netc).It all boils down to the root cause of Evil: the love of Money (not the\\nneed or use of it, but the LOVE of it), AND Popularity as well.When the\\nPastor\\'s/Singer\\'s minds are set on Money, he resorts to using fun,\\nentertainment and other worldly things to steal people\\'s attention, by\\nintroducing worldly things like mixed motivational talks, forming STRANGE\\nAmerican or other type of accents, Christain-Rock Music, Worldly Dance and\\nBEATS, Christian Films/drama/Comedy, ETC.The Word of God, and things of His\\nkingdom are FAR TOO SERIOUS for fun and entertainment of men.Yes, It\\'s good to\\nbe cheerful, joyful and have good sense of humour, BUT the things of Jesus and\\nHis Kingdom SHOULD NOT be subjects of Fun/Entertainments nor Jokes.Except we\\ndon\\'t believe, there are LOST Souls burning in Hell, and things here drawing\\nus towards that evil path, making God\\'s will detestable to us. So, it\\'s\\ndefinitely NOT WISE to focus on Christian Entertainments as they very common\\namong Christians these days.It says in Mark chap. 6 that Herod loved listening\\nto John the Baptist (like sermons). However, he also enjoyed watching WORLDLY\\ngirl\\'s DANCE with others (for pleasure), which led to the KILLING of John the\\nBaptist (a great Man of God):Mark 6:20,22,24 KJVFor Herod FEARED John, knowing\\nthat he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him,\\nhe did many things, and HEARD HIM GLADLY. AND:[22] And when the daughter of\\nthe said Herodias came in, and DANCED, and PLEASED Herod and THEM that sat\\nwith him, the king said unto the damsel, ASK of me WHATSOEVER thou wilt, and I\\nwill give it thee.A Prophet\\'s HEAD? [24] And she went forth, and said unto her\\nmother, What shall I ASK? And she said, The HEAD of John the Baptist.Terrible,\\nHerod killed John to SATISFY an entertainer (female dancer), and perhaps other\\npeople present on his BIRTHDAY!We need to judge ourselves FIRST and\\nRepent!Like herod, do we ENJOY powerful sermons, and ALSO worldly pleasures at\\nthe same time (maybe in secret)? To say PRAISE God before people, but go back\\nhome to listen to and WATCH FILTHY films, songs, dances, lustful videos,\\nsports, etc?We\\'ve got to be honest, humble and then Repent before God to\\nescape His wrath.Jesus warned:Mark 8:15 KJVAnd HE charged them, saying, Take\\nheed, BEWARE of the LEAVEN of the Pharisees, and of the \"LEAVEN OF\\nHerod\".Finally:Romans 8:13 KJVFor if ye LIVE AFTER the flesh, ye SHALL DIE:\\nbut if ye THROUGH the Spirit do MORTIFY THE DEEDS of the \"body\", ye SHALL\\nLIVE.May the Lord Jesus bless you.\\n\\n',\n",

They\\ndid their work quickly and lived with the family for almost seven years.Then,\\none night in February 1933, Mr. Lancelin, who had been waiting for his wife at\\na friend's house, came home to find her and their adult daughter dead on the\\nfloor in a pool of blood. Their eyes had been gouged out and faces smashed in.\\nThe Papin sisters were locked in their room and after getting a locksmith to\\nopen the door, the police said they found the sisters lying on the bed\\ntogether with a bloody hammer nearby, according to The Vintage News.The Papin\\nsisters immediately confessed to the crimes. While in prison, Christine became\\nvery distressed from being away from her sister and was eventually granted\\npermission to see Léa. Reports said that the sisters seemed to be unnaturally\\nclose to each other, with some suggesting a sexual relationship, though\\ndoctors who examined the Papin sisters denied evidence of that.A few months\\nlater, Christine suffered a mental breakdown and tried to gouge out her own\\neyes(yes she was insightful ) Well After their trial, Christine was sentenced\\nto life in prison for being the mastermind behind the murders, while Léa was\\neventually released from prison in 1943 and managed to get a job at a French\\nhotel under a new identity.

They are\\nalways mesmerised by the concept of faith in a spiritual being, the corruption\\nof men exploiting it, and their time-bound conviction of doubts on reality\\nsuch as informed by the paradox of that reality. They are polarised; they live\\nin both pretences and truth but more in pretences. Atheists struggle to attain\\nvivid clarifications on the contradictions that pervade the behavioural\\nexpressions of faith of the so called the faithful and the constitution of\\nmoral codes they claim to believe in. If you see any atheist, best believe, he\\nor she could only be identified by the strap of a bag or bags full of\\nquestions, be it foolish ones, incoherent ones, delusional ones or wise\\nones.Above all, atheists are popular with the use vulgars and abusive words\\npurposely to threaten and spark off your beliefs and to confirm the validity\\nor truth of such belief of claim. Their excoriations of you are tests of your\\ntenacity. This means, you cannot allow yourself to be fooled by them. You can\\nonly use them because really they are useful.On the contrary, atheists are\\neasily shaken, threatened and bedazzled when they see you keep on believing in\\nthe truth of faith.This is so because atheists are simply wanderers who are\\ndissatisfied with what they thought does not deserve the reality of true\\nreality and so in their search for that reality, they disclaim the creator of\\nthe reality which they seek more expressly because capitalists and thieves\\nalso claim the same creator as the creator of the reality which atheists deny.\\nHelpless as they are, atheists cannot overrule the essence of a creator. This\\nalone is a big threat.Atheists are not necessarily non believers. they\\nbelieve. The difference is, they simply are in search of a better 'God'. But\\nthe problem is that the God which they now deny must first be accepted in\\norder for them to be able to create the world that is better for all. Atheists\\nare non-conservatives and progressives. They are heroes of the ideal world of\\nscience and technology though with spite of the idealism of that physics. They\\nhope for glory and hates with passion anything that tends to deconstruct its\\nrealisation even that anthema comes in the name of a revered God. Lol.\\nUnfortunately, this becomes a form of drunkenness which now find difficulty in\\ndistinguishing between exploitation and exploiters, patience and scheme, etc.\\nHowever we have a challenge at hand and that is the fear that atheists in the\\ncourse of searching may have lost their hearts so much that they eventually\\ncreate a far dangerous devil in themselves and after all, become like the\\nexploiters who blasphemes religion or like the God which they hate.History is\\na great teacher.

              "  'content': 'Let me start by saying that this article isn’t for atheists or unbelievers or\\nthose who have a strong aversion to the subject of tithing. It is for those\\nbelieving Christians who are open-minded and willing to learn more about the\\nconcept of tithing. My humble advice to atheists or unbelievers is to first\\nbelieve in God, repent today, and accept His Son, Jesus Christ, as their Lord\\nand Saviour. Life is short. Time is short. Death is sure. Eternity awaits us\\nall. Let me stress that this article is by no means a monopoly on the subject\\nof tithing. For decades the tithe has remained a subject of intense debate,\\nespecially in Christendom. There are two main schools of thought regarding\\nthis rather sensitive matter. While the first school believes that tithing is\\nan Old Testament requirement, the second school is of the opinion that it\\nextends to the New Testament. But an inspired study of the Scriptures reveals\\na surprising truth: God does NOT require that we should PAY tithe! This book\\nwill open your eyes to the lies and deception that many so-called ministers\\nhave built around the tithe in order to keep enriching themselves at the\\nexpense of poor and ignorant souls… Let me commence by defining the word,\\ntithe. The old English word for it is \\'teotha,\\' which means a tenth. Generally\\nspeaking, tithe is a tenth part of profits or fruits legally acquired, owed to\\nGod in recognition of His Sovereignty, and supreme dominion, and given to His\\nministers for the furtherance of His Kingdom on earth. Now, no doubt, a lot\\nhas been said and written for and against paying tithe. There are those who\\ndon’t believe in paying their tithes, because for them it’s an old covenant\\nprecept; there are those who pay theirs to the poor in the society, because\\nthey would rather do that and impact humanity positively than give their money\\nto a so-called man of God who they believe would end up squandering their hard\\nearned money; and then there are those who pay their tithes routinely – out of\\na sense of duty, and not that they are really expecting anything in return\\nfrom God; and of course there are those who are threatened or arm twisted into\\npaying their tithes…and the list goes on. Money is one sensitive and painful\\nsubject many people want to avoid. But the truth is that God’s view on\\nfinances is paramount to fundamental Christianity. Delving straight into the\\nmatter; I’d like to categorically state here that there is no such thing as\\nPAYING your tithe in the Bible. As New Covenant Christians we are to GIVE our\\ntithe. LUKE 6: 38, ACTS 20: 35, I CORINTHIANS 9: 6-10, and others. The tithe\\nis not an Old Covenant precept; no, it actually began before that. Many people\\nhave the rather erroneous notion that the Old Testament begins from Genesis.\\nThey forget that the Old Testament, which is the Law, actually began when God\\ngave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mt. Sinai. There are three dispensations as\\nfar as Scripture is concerned. We have the ‘Conscience Dispensation,’ which\\nbegan from Man’s fall in Eden until Moses got the Ten Commandments. The ‘Law\\nDispensation’ began from that moment until Christ uttered these eternal words\\n‘It Is Finished’ on the cross. From that moment ‘Grace Dispensation,’ our\\npresent, dispensation, came into play. The first man to give tithe in\\nScripture was Abraham; a man who lived during the Conscience Dispensation,\\nGENESIS 14: 20; HEBREWS 7:6. And let’s not forget, the first man to give an\\noffering to God, Abel, also lived during the Conscience era. GENESIS 4: 3. The\\nimportance of giving one’s tithe can never be overemphasized. Why? Because as\\nwe see in MALACHI 3: 10 God staked His very reputation on it. He says “…prove\\nme now herewith.” In other words, He’s means, “Try me and see if I will not\\ngive you the blessings attached to giving your tithes.” Yes, it’s true there\\nare manifold blessings attached to giving one’s tithes. However I am troubled\\nby the rather brazen manner in which many so-called ministers, today, go about\\ngetting people to pay (instead of give) their tithes. They threaten, arm-\\ntwist, and manipulate their members into giving their tithes. They make them\\nbelieve that they are robbing God; and as such they are under a curse. They\\nmake people feel condemned; in fact they ascribe the lack of answers to\\npeople’s prayers to their lack of giving their tithes. These people use the\\ncurse pronounced in MALACHI 3:8 as a sort of truncheon to beat people over the\\nhead. They tell people, “Look, if you don’t pay your tithes to God, you are\\nunder His curse; He’s angry with you; and He’s going to get you one way or\\nanother.” And since no one wants to be under a curse, or wants God to come\\nafter them they go ahead and give. In the end people give out of fear; and\\nwhen you do that…you’re giving grudgingly. On the other hand, when someone\\nmanipulates you into giving, then you’re doing it out of necessity. And all\\nthis is just plain wrong. Don’t let anyone compel you into parting with your\\nmoney. Am I saying, as a Christian believer, you shouldn’t give? Of course\\nnot! But give voluntarily, as you’re led by the Holy Spirit. But here’s the\\ntruth. And I want you to pay close attention. Under the dispensation of Grace,\\ngiving your tithe is NOT an obligation. You are free to give your tithe or not\\nto do so. If you don’t give your tithe, believe me when I say that you are not\\nunder any curse. God is not angry with you; He is not going to come at you.\\nGod is not a mafia boss, who demands protection money from people. Don’t\\nlisten to anyone who tells you that if you don’t give your tithe, God will\\ntake it away from you in one way or the other; maybe by inflicting you with\\nsickness, so you’ll have to pay hospital bills…or some other painful way. God\\nblesses us not because of our performance but because Christ made us\\nrighteous. In the first instance, every born again child of God has been\\nredeemed from the curse of the Law, GALATIANS 3:13. And that includes the\\ncurse in MALACHI 3:18. And then JOHN 3:16, one of the most popular references\\nin Scripture, tells us that “For God so loved the world…” Again in EPHESIANS\\n2:4-5 we are made to understand that while we were dead in sin God loved us\\nwith a great love. Also, ROMANS 5:8 tells us that God demonstrates His love\\ntoward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Now, if God\\nloved us as sinners how about now that we’ve received His son as our Lord and\\nSavior? Child of God, God loves you…whether you give your tithe or not. In II\\nCORINTHIANS 9:6-7 we see another often read but not properly or wholly\\ninterpreted Scripture. It talks about sowing sparingly and reaping sparingly;\\nand also sowing bountifully and reaping bountifully. Straight to the point,\\nyou are not obligated to pay ten percent all the time. In other words you can\\ngive less than ten percent as your tithes, and still God is not going to get\\nmad at you. That’s sowing sparingly. You can give less than ten percent… See,\\nit is better to give less than ten percent cheerfully than to give ten percent\\ngrudgingly, or out of necessity. And that’s exactly what many are doing today.\\nThey are arm twisted into giving their tithes. God loves a cheerful giver. God\\nis not interested in the percentage you give as much as He is in your motive\\nfor giving. Remember, for God so loved the world. God gave His Son,\\ncheerfully, out of His love. So, if you feel comfortable with giving God less\\nthan ten percent at that moment, with peace and joy, then do so. And like we\\nare told you’ll still get your blessings…though sparingly. On the other hand,\\nyou can give ten percent or more than that. That’s the bountiful part….and you\\nshall reap bountifully. Again, you are not under any curse if you do not give\\nyour tithe and offering. God loves you all the same. God’s love is constant;\\nit doesn’t fluctuate based on your actions. God won’t love you more when you\\ndo right; neither will He love you less when you do wrong. ACTS 17:28 tells us\\nthat we live and move and have our being in God. He put His wrath on Jesus, so\\nHe’s not mad at you. But the truth is that there are manifold blessings\\nattached to giving your tithes and offerings, cheerfully and with love. One\\nmajor reason people are not getting the blessings is because they are not\\ngiving cheerfully. The motive behind our giving is far more important than our\\ngiving. Your tithe is a powerful seed. In agriculture, a farmer sows seeds to\\nreap a harvest. In much the same way, God gives us seeds; but what we choose\\nto do with them is up to us. Planting our seeds (giving our tithes) guarantees\\na future harvest for us. But don’t forget, God isn’t mad at you if you don’t\\nplant your seed. He loves you even if you eat all your seeds; but don’t be\\nastonished when you run out of money. It’s not God’s fault that you ate all\\nyour seeds. That is why you should exercise enough discipline to take a\\nportion of what God has given you and sow it into your future. Personally, I\\nbelieve that if those guys under the Law could part with ten percent, then we\\nwho are under Grace should be able to do better. As a result, since I\\nunderstood and really began practicing the concept of giving, I have\\nendearvoured to give nothing less than ten percent. Of course this is\\npersonal; it\\'s not for everyone; it comes with spiritual maturity and the\\nextent of one\\'s revelation of the subject-matter. Many don’t give their tithes\\nbecause as far they are concerned we are under Grace; and according to II\\nCorinthians 8: 9 Christ has already settled all our debts; that we are no\\nlonger obligated to give our tithes. This is not exactly true. You forget that\\nin JOHN 3:16 God GAVE… And in GENESIS 14:20 Abraham GAVE… If Abraham, our\\nfather after the flesh (ROMANS 4:1), gave his tithe, then I think we also\\nshould too. And for those who give their tithes to the poor; it’s good…but\\nyou’ll only receive the blessings attached to giving to the poor. PROVERBS\\n19:17 I am not naïve; I know that a lot of weird stuff is going on in many\\nchurches. There are places where the giving of tithe has been downplayed, and\\nnow it’s all about seed sowing. A lot of abominable things are being done in\\nthe name of seed sowing. I know a pastor who literally threatens his members\\nwith the fact that God will inflict them one sickness or the other, tragedy\\nand even death if they fail to sow seeds. And then he’ll start from a certain\\namount of money, let’s say N10, 000 and counted down to N200. And people,\\nscared to their scalps, will rush out to sow the seed. There are places where\\npeople are given tithe and offering/ seed sowing cards to fill and submit to\\nthe pastor; the idea is enable the pastor monitor how faithful or frequent his\\nmembers are in the sowing of their seeds. That’s ridiculous. And then there is\\nthe first fruit deception. There are churches where every first month of the\\nnew year, the members give their first salary, all of it, as tithe and\\noffering or some other kind of seed, based on what their pastors have made\\nthem believe. That’s absolute nonsense. Please listen, under this dispensation\\nof Grace, God will NOT tell someone to tell you to go and clear out your\\naccount and bring the money to him. If anyone tells you that…then he is either\\nignorant, or a criminal in God’s house. Please understand that you can decide,\\nof your own free volition, to make a vow to God; that is something personal;\\nbetween you and Him. You should decide…not your pastor. And let me quickly\\nexplain what first fruit means as stated in PROVERBS 3:9. First fruits simply\\nmean the very first thing we do after getting money. We are to set aside some\\nof that money as our tithe and offering, first – right before we take care of\\nour other needs. It does not mean we should throw in our entire salary, for\\nthe month, in some basket or church account. Please understand, the most\\npowerful seed you can ever sow is your tithe and offering. Before I go further\\nI’d like to say something here concerning offering. Your offering is a gift.\\nPeople ask how much they should give as offering. My simple answer is:\\nwhatever amount the Holy Spirit puts in your heart to give. And it should be\\ndone freely. I CHRONICLES 29:6, 9. There are people who say that our offering\\nshould be equivalent to our tithe. That’s one big lie. It’s crucial to note\\nthat the passage in MALACHI 3:8 says that the curse comes for robbing God in\\ntithes and offerings. The ministers who teach tithing from a Law perspective\\nseem to deliberately overlook the fact you also have to give offerings to keep\\nthe Law. And back then there were so many offerings that altogether totaled\\nabout 33%. So, anyone who is trying to live by the Law is cursed unless they\\nare giving 33% offering as well. Today, we don’t tithe in an attempt to keep\\nthe Law; instead we tithe out of appreciation for what God has done for us;\\nour tithing is a response from our hearts as we seek to bless people. The\\ntithe is for our benefit, not God’s. LUKE 16:11 says, “And I say unto you,\\nmake to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that when ye\\nfail, they may receive you into everlasting habitation.” The Greek word,\\n‘fail’ is translated to mean death or die. A major advantage of using money to\\ntouch people’s lives is that when you die, those people will assemble in\\nHeaven to thank you for using your resources to help them. Do you know that\\nChrist spoke about money more than He did about any other thing: salvation,\\nhealing, deliverance, evangelism? Yes He did. That simply tells us that God is\\nquite interested in our finances. God wants us to give; that’s why He didn’t\\nask us to pay a certain amount; instead the tithe is based on percentage, so\\nthat everyone can give. For me, not giving is simply an indication that you\\ndon’t trust God. See, the least (simplest) thing a man can trust God with is\\nhis finances, LUKE 16:11. I can go further and state that if you can’t trust\\nGod with your money then I wonder how you’ll trust Him to heal you. Please,\\ndon’t get me wrong; I’m not tying giving to your receiving your healing. No.\\nI’m just saying it’s much easier to trust God with your finances (something\\nphysical) than it is to do so with Him healing you. Not giving is a clear-cut\\nindication that we don’t trust God; that we’re yet to recognize Him as the\\nsource of our abundance. JAMES 1:17 tells us that “Every good gift and every\\nperfect gift is from above…” There are people who are afraid to give; they\\nhave a rather strong grip on their money. They believe they’ve earned it; that\\nthey’ve worked for it. They can’t imagine giving a dime out of it to others.\\nThey don’t give their tithe and offering, they don’t give to others, they\\ndon’t give in support of the gospel; they just hold on tightly to all they\\nhave. And a lot of Christians are guilty of this. The rich ruler in MARK\\n10:17, 18, was guilty of this. These people forget that “There is that\\nscattereth and yet increaseth, and there is that withholdeth more than is\\nmeet, but it tendeth to poverty.” PROVERBS 11:24. You wonder how someone can\\nprosper by scattering what he has. You can’t really grasp that with your\\ncarnal mind. But that’s what the Scripture says. In God’s economy you prosper\\nwhen you start giving out of love and in faith. It is God’s blessing upon your\\nlife that gives you the ability to prosper. Abraham gave because he recognized\\nGod as his source of his abundance. He prospered not just because he was\\nhardworking, but because of God’s blessings upon his life. Despite his flaws\\nGod blessed him in all he did. HEBREWS 6:13. If God wanted to miraculously\\nprovide money for every ministry He could have; but instead He set up the\\ngiving/tithing structure. He really wants us to give. He wants us to\\nparticipate in giving. Again, when we give, it’s for our own sake…not for\\nGod’s. God doesn’t need our money. He owns the silver, gold,\\nriches…everything. Everything in existence belongs to Him. He even owns\\nexistence itself. It is true that one can prosper without God. But such\\nprosperity comes with heartache. Prosperity is a functional part of our\\nsalvation. I CORINTHIANS 8:9. God does not give us wealth; He anoints the work\\nof our hands and causes it to prosper. And bear in mind: once God’s favor is\\non our lives, it cannot be stopped – except by our unbelief/negative thinking.\\nFurthermore, it’s essential for you to give where you’re fed; where you’re\\ninspired, and not where you’re begged or put under pressure; or where you’re\\ncoerced, intimidated or condemned. Do not give out of desperation; do not give\\ndesperately because someone manipulated you into thinking that God would\\nsurely supply all your needs. You cannot buy a miracle. It’s not enough to\\ngive your tithes to your local church; you should endeavor to give to a good\\nlocal church. If your local church isn’t feeding you properly, then it makes\\nno sense giving your tithes there. Again, do no limit your giving to just your\\nlocal church. Give to genuine missionaries who are laboring in faraway\\ncountries, taking the good news to those that are impoverished. Also give\\nbenevolently – to widows, orphans, the poor generally. In other words a bulk\\nof your giving can go to your local church, while the rest can go the\\nmentioned areas. On a final note, the highest form of giving is to help share\\nthe Gospel of Grace. Remember to give voluntarily. Give your tithe and\\noffering cheerfully, motivated by love, and see prosperity flow your way. Once\\nagain, if you\\'re yet to give your life to Jesus Christ...today is another\\ngreat opportunity to do so. Do it right now. Waste no single second. Jesus is\\nwaiting with His arms wide open. God\\'s angels can\\'t wait to enter your name in\\nthe Book Of Life. Heaven can\\'t wait to receive you as one of its inhabitants\\nat the end of your time on earth. A simple prayer is all it takes: \"Lord\\nJesus, today I confess and repent of my sins. I acknowledge Your death for me\\non the cross. I receive Your forgiveness. Come into my heart. I make You my\\nLord and Saviour.\\n\\n',\n",

We have evil-doers that hide under the canopy of\\nChristianity and dent the image of Christ. The church now faces the\\npersecutions as we have evil and chronic anti-Christ agents whose mission is\\nto mislead new converts and fall the genuine Christians who have their feet\\nshaking in Christ. The selected part of the scripture today has a deeper\\nmeaning than just a question. If we should continue to ruminate on this, we\\nwill see clearly that rather than just a question, the scriptural reading\\nindicates something about the cost of followership. There are costs attached,\\nand Christ-followers should be ready to pay it off. The message is clear,\\nJesus says, my kingdom is not of this world, I do not come to give you peace\\non this earth. To follow Christ, you must be ready to pay the price of\\nfollowership yourself. No controversial or ceremonial Christian can step feet\\ninto the kingdom of God. We are required to be certified and genuine\\nChristian. Christians must be ready for persecution and tribulations from the\\nworld, ‘claimed’ Christians, and the spiritual forces. Real and genuine\\nChristians should know that there are prices to pay in this world. These are\\nlittle out of many costs we owe to pay off: Shedding off sins: (John 3 vs. 3 &\\nGal 5 vs. 19) Remember, God hates sins. A Christian that enjoys sins does not\\npay any price. Our God is holy, and we can only serve Him in holiness. God has\\ncalled us out of the old life (sins and immorality) to be a holy nation and\\npeculiar people. If you want to identify with Christ, you have to pay the\\nprice of holiness. Get ready for rejection and more enemies: (1st Cor. 1 vs.\\n18) the world will surely reject and abuse you for following Christ. That is\\npart of the cost. If you read James 4:4 from the other way round, it will read\\nthus: “know ye not that enmity with the world, is the friendship with God?”\\nGod expects you to pay certain prices. Irrespective of the decayed world,\\nfaithful Christians have to stand out and not mix with this world. Persecution\\nmay come from even fake pastors, fake Christians, parents, possessed friends,\\netc., as Christians, the price to be paid is to take your ground and stand out\\nof the crowd. It will cost you your possession and time: God expects us to\\ndevote little out of the time and riches He has given us on this Earth to\\nserve Him. Unfortunately, many Christians, through our lifestyles and busy\\nschedules, we tell God, “I can’t share this little time with you.” As a true\\nChristian, God expects that we spend time to read the scripture, pray, and\\npreach His gospel. These are the cost of discipleship that we all must pay. I\\nchallenge you today to give more to God and pay your cost before the owner of\\nthe soul demands it. A little contribution to the work of evangelism could go\\na long way. Little time to visit the orphanage homes, hospitals, and specials\\nschools will make an excellent record. Stop giving excuses. Pay your tithe and\\nhelp the needy. Support the true evangelism work of God. These are the cost of\\nfollowership. Thanks for reading, & God bless you!\\n\\n',\n",

The police patrol the\\npedestrian zone frequently, it is usually peaceful, and the officers sometimes\\nwave to the many children playing. The situation was similar on the evening of\\nMay 17: at 6:07 p.m., a uniformed patrol car crew consisting of two officers\\nand a third-year commissioner candidate was noticed by the German-Lebanese S.,\\nan 18-year-old frequent offender who is known to police and is a member of a\\nlarge Lebanese family. This is a momentous encounter that will lead to a\\npublic reopening of the conflicts in the north of Duisburg and will make\\nheadlines nationwide in the following days.Against S., born in Duisburg in\\nJuly 2001, 75 investigations have already been carried out since 2014, mainly\\nfor property and violent crime, as stated in an investigative report by the\\npolice headquarters in Duisburg about the recent violence in Marxloh. The 13\\npages are available to our editors. The report is declared with VS (classified\\ninformation) – only for official use.There is a pre-trial detention order\\nagainst S. for dangerous bodily harm. That is why he escaped that May evening\\nwhen he saw the officials, accompanied by two people who, according to the\\npolice, are said to belong to the support group of the Lebanese-born extended\\nfamily. He ran into a residential building – dangerous terrain for the police.\\nThe blocks, according to the mission report, have a freely accessible system\\nof cellars and backyards, and are inhabited by large Lebanese families.\\nNevertheless, the police officers decided to persecute S., but they request\\nreinforcement by radio.Large Arab families in Essen: Criminal clans threaten\\npolice officersIn the block of houses, S. wanted to flee into an apartment,\\nbut when he rang the doorbell, the door was not opened immediately. The police\\ntook advantage of this and caught up with him. They overwhelmed him with an\\n“irritant sprayer” and “with simple physical violence.”Meanwhile, the\\ncandidate for the commissioner blocked the front door of the house so that no\\nsupporters of S. could come to his aid. Outside, 25 people were already\\nprotesting loudly against the police operation. The reinforcements arrived and\\ncleared the space, but were attacked, and some officers suffered minor\\ninjuries. S. threatened the police with death: he said he would kill them all\\nat some point. Everyone knew how big his family was and who the police had\\njust messed with.Since the arrest of S. “the conflict seems to be boiling\\nagain in and around Marxloh,” according to investigators. The police tactic of\\nzero tolerance, which has been used in the field for several years, actually\\nworks. Since 2017, with 24 “tumult situations,” the number has been reduced to\\neleven in 2018 and four in the past year, as stated in the present\\ninvestigation file. But just in the days after the arrest in the stairwell\\nthere were two further tumult situations in the north of Duisburg, on May 19\\nand May 28.On May 22, it is stated in the file, the police headquarters in\\nDuisburg received an email with the threat of an attack and a warning to\\nwithdraw from Marxloh. “Subject: Allahu Akbar, Duisburg-Marxloh is our\\ndistrict. (…) We prohibit all unbelievers from entering our district. We will\\ndrive away or kill all police officers, journalists and other unbelievers by\\nforce of arms. For us, only the radical Sharia law applies,” says the letter.\\n“We got 2,000 AK-47 assault rifles from Turkey and Russia with enough\\nammunition. Allahu Akbar, kill all unbelievers.”Investigators find that the\\nsender’s email address is part of a platform that disguises email addresses\\nand identities. Investigators appear to be taking the threats seriously.\\nAccording to the police file, the public prosecutor’s office sees this as an\\ninitial suspicion of disturbing public peace through the threat of\\ncrime….Source\\n\\n',\n",

But the\\nchildren of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be\\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.” Matthew 8:11-12 The words above were spoken by\\nJesus when He saw how great the faith of the Centurion was. He attested to the\\nfact that He had never seen such great faith in Israel. This man was\\nconsidered an unbeliever, yet he had faith that was greater than that of\\neveryone Jesus had met.A chronic unbeliever who has an encounter with Christ\\nwould likely hold on to Him fervently. On the other hand, the one who has been\\na Christian for a long while, especially since childhood, has a great tendency\\nto begin to take Jesus for granted. In Luke 7:36-47, Jesus dined at a\\nPharisee’s house, but the man did not even offer to wash His feet; he took\\nsuch an august visitor for granted because he had known Him for long. Many\\nChristians are fervent in the first few months or years after they encounter\\nChrist, and then begin to relent. This could be because the memory of their\\nsalvation experience is beginning to wane or they may have seen other\\nChristians slipping and still looking holy. Beloved, it is very dangerous to\\nforget your salvation encounter with Christ, very dangerous to take examples\\nfrom people who are not as fervent as you; rather, take examples from those\\nwho have gone higher than you in the faith.Hold on to Jesus for dear life!\\nWhen He gives you an instruction, obey immediately. Always go early for Church\\nservices; if you are a worker in the Church, serve to the best of your\\nability. Make Him a priority in your life; increase your commitment to His\\nKingdom rather than reducing it. I pray that you will not be replaced in the\\nkingdom of God in the mighty name of Jesus.

I\\'m saying the god described here doesn\\'t\\nexist. The Bible was written by men who had power over others, and the\\nhierarchy the Bible cements into place is for their benefit. It is you who\\nbelieve in a god who encourages and enables predators and abusers of power. I\\ndo not.]This gift of power to abusers makes the Lord\\'s Prayer *obscene.* We\\'re\\ntreated to the spectacle of Jesus Christ praying these words to his father,\\n\"And lead us not into temptation . . .\" while that\\'s *exactly* what the\\nhierarchy he put in place does. The god commands the submission of those who\\nalready have very little power and autonomy--women, children, those in poverty\\nand other weakened conditions--to their superiors, *as they would submit to\\nGod, Himself*--and there\\'s no out clause from this abject submission, even\\nwhen the superior is flagrantly disobedient to the god.The god, himself, leads\\nthese authorities into temptation. There\\'s no sense entertaining the argument\\nthat IF all people were obedient to the god, THEN it would be a perfect\\nsystem. Is the god unaware that humans have the propensity for evil? He knows\\nwho he\\'s working with! And yet, he gives a strong incentive for the authority\\nfigure to abuse his god-given power: delayed punishment, that can be\\ncompletely avoided by properly timing true repentance for these sins, before\\none\\'s death. We see that the specter of hellfire didn\\'t stop Christians in the\\nclergy from abusing children. And not all abusers even believe in a life after\\nthis one. Regardless, justice delayed is justice denied. Abuse destroys lives,\\nand the tragic ripple effect often continues through many generations.\\nThrowing an abuser into a lake of fire--especially if he was an abuse victim,\\nhimself, as a child--doesn\\'t wash anything away.One need only look at the much\\nhigher rates of domestic abuse in patriarchal religious homes, to gain a sense\\nof how the Bible\\'s requirement of submission to human authority figures tempts\\nabusive men to do as they wish and leaves their wives with no choice but to\\nsubmit to abuse, in order to please a god. Again, the god knew he was making\\nthese women that he lovingly created *punching bags.* Submission by one group\\nto another, ordered by a god, makes the authority who dominates them think\\nthey\\'re morally inferior. It dehumanizes.The basic, underlying structure of\\nChristianity promotes strife, and abuse, and injustice. Then the Bible has the\\naudacity to blame all of this evil on the hearts of men. No amount of \"Thou\\nShalt Nots\" can fix it. Only a complete overhaul of religious belief will do,\\nand that must begin with the realization that no god inspired this book. There\\nis no objective morality, here, handed down by an actual god.How can anyone\\nstill imagine a god behind such a system, obviously set up to benefit\\npredators, abusers, and corrupt leaders in positions of power, and to\\nperpetuate crime, and misery, and injustice. It\\'s clear who benefits from it!\\nAnd that should point all of us toward the actual writers of it.Michelle hopes\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'In a post made by Journalist Paul Dada he earns people to stop listening to\\nApostle Selman due to the errors he preach.In a popular video trending now by\\nApostle Selman, Paul Dada said Apostle Selman misinterpreted the Bible .Watch\\nthe video below and see what Paul Dada has to say.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH07djeJwNc15 ERRORS OF A SELF-STYLED APOSTLE\\nCALLED JOSHUA SELMANError 1 There is no dominion in povertyThe above statement\\nbetrays his misunderstanding of the nature of the Christian\\'s dominion from\\nthe New Testament perspective.Jesus Christ came for one purpose, and that is\\nto save us from our sins.Read John 1:29\" The next day John seeth Jesus coming\\nunto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the\\nworld.\"Read Matthew 1:21\"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call\\nhis name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.\"Read also Mathew\\n26:28, Romans 3:25Jesus did not die to make us rich. Many people were rich\\nbefore Christ came. Many are rich who don\\'t love Christ or care about Him.The\\nnature of the Christian dominion is the victory over sin.Romans 6:14 says\\n:\"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but\\nunder grace.\"In the early church era, most people were poor. Can we say they\\ndid not have dominion? No. They were not thinking of dominion in terms of\\naffluence.In 2 Corinthians 8:1-3, Paul said the churches of Macedonia were in\\ndeep poverty. The likes of Selman would say those brethren had no dominion\\nbecause they were poor. But God does not think so.Error 2: People choose to be\\npoor or richSelman gleefully quotes Proverbs 22: 2.See it:\" The rich and poor\\nmeet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.\"He misinterprets it to mean\\nthat people choose their conditions in life. First off, the verse does not\\nmean that. The verse is simply saying that both the rich and the poor are made\\nby God. The implication of this is that the rich should not despise the poor\\nwhile the poor should not resent the rich as they are both made by God.While\\nit is true that some people become poor because they are lazy and not smart,\\nothers wallow in poverty because of failure of government. Yet, there are\\npeople who are poor because God in His sovereignty allowed it.Read 1 Samuel\\n2:7\"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth\\nup.\"Who caused Job to become poor? Was it not God that permitted Satan to\\nafflict Job?Yes, God allows poverty in the lives of some of His children. And\\nHe does it to try their faith or accomplish noble purposes in their\\nlives.Error 3: Abraham made impact because he was rich while Lazarus couldn\\'t\\nbecause he was poorTrue, Abraham was rich. But scripturally, is his impact on\\nhis generation and generations after him , measured by his wealth or by his\\nfaith, righteousness, humility and commitment to God? Will Selman and his co-\\ntravellers stop handling the word of God dishonestly?Peter, Paul and others\\nwere not rich, yet the impact of their strides in the kingdom, is still felt\\ntoday. At least 13 of the books written by Paul are still with us today.\\nPlease, run away from Selman\\'s warped theology.In the Old Testament, Elijah, a\\npoor prophet made more impact than all the rich people of his time.How much\\ndid John the Baptist have? Yet his level of impact on the conscience of many\\nof those who listened to him was great.4: Error 4: InconsistencySelman quoting\\nProverbs 22:2 has earlier said people choose their economic conditions. But\\nquoting verse 7, he admits the rich can manipulate the economy to subjugate\\nthe poor.5: Error 5: Irrelevant analogyThere is no correlation between\\nProverbs 22:7 and one having the whole world and losing their soul. Can people\\njust learn to stay within contexts when exegeting the scriptures? And why he\\ncalls Jesus a businessman beats me. This is totally irrelevant.Error 6:\\nPoverty and Wisdom do not go hand in handThis is total rubbish. Wealth is not\\nalways a function of wisdom. And not every form of poverty is a consequence of\\nlack of wisdom.In fact anyone who fears God regardless of what their financial\\nstatus,is wise( Proverbs 2:1-5).Error 7: A totally horrible misinterpretation\\nof Ecclesiastes 9:13-15These verses tell the story of a poor wise man who with\\nhis wisdom delivered a city from a looming attack, but he is not remembered or\\nappreciated for his exploit. Selman interprets it to mean that wisdom is not\\nenough as one needs to be financially buoyant to pass their message to the\\nworld.But the verses have nothing to do with possessing money. The passage is\\ntelling us about the carnality of men and how they despise even the poor who\\nhave served or are serving the society.Hear Proverbs 8:11\" For wisdom is\\nbetter than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be\\ncompared to it.\"According to the bible, wisdom is better than wealth. Do you\\nhear, Selman?It may be argued that, money is needed to support the spread of\\nthe gospel. But in the early church which was made up of mostlypoor people,\\nthe work of the ministry was still funded. Poor brethren contributed from\\ntheir meagre resources to support ministers.Error 8- Prosperity played a role\\nin salvation. It took prosperity and Influence for salvation to come.This is\\nthe blindest and most blasphemous of the utterances made by Selman. In making\\na case for his perverted prosperity gospel, Selman says angels couldn\\'t bring\\nJesus down from the cross. It was Joseph of Arimathea, a man on influence and\\nprosperity that could reach the governor to demand the body of Christ.The\\nimplication of this most foolish statement is that Joseph played a role in our\\nsalvation. Joseph\\'s influence and prosperity made our salvation complete.\\nJesus would have remained on the cross and may not have resurrected. Joseph\\nhelped Jesus to fulfill His plan of redemption. Joseph is now our Deputy\\nSaviour.In reality, Joseph was just a lover of Jesus who thought to give him a\\n\"befitting\" burial. He was not more special or more relevant than the women\\nwho went with spices to his grave to anoint his body. If Joseph was not\\navailable, Jesus would still have resurrected.Would it make sense to say\\nvirginity played a role in our salvation because Mary the earthly mother got\\npregnant with him when she was a virgin?Selman is treading on a dangerous\\nground. Somebody should tell him.Error 9: The Gospel is heavy; it takes wealth\\nas an ark-bearer to lift it.This assertion is a total lie. The gospel thrived\\nin the early church era without the majority of the believers being rich. In\\nIran today where Christians are being persecuted and are treated less than\\nsecond class citizens, the gospel is being preached and reaches people faster\\nthan it does in prosperous America. Wealth is not the ark bearer of the\\ngospel. What we need is the power of the Holy Spirit.10: If you are not at a\\ncertain level of economic empowerment you will not hear certain instructions\\nfrom GodSelman\\'s God must be different from the real God of the Bible.\\nSelman\\'s God speaks to people based on their economic power. Selman\\'s God\\ncherishes the rich more than the poor. Nothing in the scriptures supports this\\nlie.11. God gave Pharaoh a dream that he couldn\\'t give Jacob and others\\nbecause the Egyptian king was a man of influence. God had to search until he\\nfound Pharaoh.But what was Pharaoh without Joseph? Pharaoh\\' s dream was\\nnothing without the interpretation of Joseph who was at the time not a man on\\ninfluence.God does what He likes the way He likes but it seems this Selman\\nwants us to believe that God respected the position and power of Pharaoh so\\nmuch.12. God cannot tell you to build a school if you are not rich\\nenoughGeorge Muller who was not a rich man, ran an orphanage. Sometimes, there\\nwould be no food. He would pray in faith and provision would come. Can someone\\ntell Selman to stop speaking rubbish?13. I will never pastor people who love\\nGod but are mediocres(sic)In Selman\\'s theology what makes a man a mediocrity\\nis that he is not rich. But God is looking for people who are rich in grace.\\nGod who owns the heaven and the earth, is not wowed by the riches that men\\nhave.14. Hunger( Poverty) will make the people of God to compromise ( go to\\nEgypt).Paul faced lack many times. He said he knew about having and lacking.\\nHe said He could do all things through Christ ( Philippians 4:13). He didn\\'t\\ndraw his strength from wealth but Christ.Error 15: If you have money and\\npassion for God you have destroyed Satan.So many believers have passion for\\nGod without being rich and they are enjoying victory over Satan.What\\'s your\\nsay on this??\\n\\n',\n",

But there is really more to Christianity than we ever\\nimagine and God can never lie to us. Recently, I was in a meeting and my mum\\nwas in that meeting, I finished praying, the truth is, I really do not blame\\nher, she has been attending a Church where there is no life, you see, it is a\\nwhole lot of experience if we choose to stand with God. By the grace of God,\\nalright, let\\'s look at it this way, by the way, Abraham\\'s blessings are ours.\\nThere is nothing wrong in getting wealth, but get it in a manner that pleases\\nGod. The truth is, we have been schooled and mentored by people who do not\\nknow the Bible and we are captives to the imaginations that has been built\\ninto us and part of the captivity that has been built into us is the fact\\nthat, some traditions has become our expectations, because we believe the\\nthings of the Spirit only manifest in the churches only when we have vigils,\\nnot knowing that those who go up in the spirit during vigils and intensive\\nservices are those who have received and understand fully well how the things\\nof the Spirit work. I am here to tell us there is more to God that we can ever\\nimagine. And there is more to God than our widest and deepest imaginations.\\nThe fact somethings has proved themselves impossible in our lives does not\\nmean they are impossible. I was talking about the meeting I was where my mum\\nwas also, I was about to start the sermon when I heard a whisper behind me\\ntelling me to preach on healing. Alright, I started preaching and I noticed I\\nsaid a lot of things about with God all things are possible. And after the\\nsermon, I made a call to prayers and when I got to her place. Immediately I\\ntouched her hands, from no where, I started crying, I could not believe that\\ndespite all the fasting and prayers she has been doing, she would still be the\\ntype that needs that much kind of prayers. Kenneth Hagin once said, you can be\\nusing a drug, but it is a wrong drug. The fact you use a random drug does not\\nmean you found the right drug, there are billions of drugs that would not cure\\nan ailment.

I believe every Christian ought\\nto hear from God because Jesus said, when the Spirit cometh, He shall \"not\\nSPEAK\" of Himself, but \"what He Hears\" that shall \"He SPEAK UNTO YOU\", so if\\nyou have the Holy Spirit you will hear from God because the Holy Spirit\\nspeaks, that is the proof of the fact that you have received the Holy Spirit,\\nyou must hear, and I didn\\'t hear until I started speaking in tongues, and I\\nstarted speaking in tongues when I was 23, and it started after a friend\\nprayed for me and I started muttering sounds I heard from my Spirit and I\\nvocalized it, it was about the 6th day or so I just heard that voice , and I\\nfelt it was my mind , until one day , I was passing beside an Hall in OAU, and\\nGod told me to give 1000 to one of the cleaners, I was like that\\'s my mind,\\nbut like a spring approaching it\\'s elasticity, the more I walked away, the\\nmore difficult it was to go further, until I stopped and I was like, woow, so\\nit is God, and I turned and I asked, which of them, cause they were about four\\nstanding and my gaze looked at one of them and I heard that one, and that was\\nhow I knew and after then, it became a thing I was conversant with, and that\\nis the will of God that we hear His voice\\n\\n',\n",
              "  'response': 'GodsMopol:Hi everyone , yeah I am sorry. It has been a while, I miss you guys\\ntoo , you know, I had other monikers and I do reach out through them. Straight\\nto the bullseye , I really did miss you guys , AmenYea, I have toured the\\nworld and it is quite below me or I still do not know or understand why many\\nChristians live below what God did for them in Jesus. My point is, a lot of\\nChristians are defeated in their expectations in life. I have been ringing\\nthis Bell for ages now, Christ came to build a Church that would prevail over\\nthe gate of hell, and that is the standard. I really do not get it at all. I\\nam open for counselling too. But it is sad what I see both online and offline\\nas a Christian. It is quite sad that the difference between those who lived\\nbefore the coming of Jesus and those who claim they have received Christ as\\ntheir Lord and personal saviour, I really pray this thread gets to the hearing\\nof so many people(Amen). But there is really more to Christianity than we ever\\nimagine and God can never lie to us. Recently, I was in a meeting and my mum\\nwas in that meeting, I finished praying, the truth is, I really do not blame\\nher, she has been attending a Church where there is no life, you see, it is a\\nwhole lot of experience if we choose to stand with God. By the grace of God,\\nalright, let\\'s look at it this way, by the way, Abraham\\'s blessings are ours.\\nThere is nothing wrong in getting wealth, but get it in a manner that pleases\\nGod. The truth is, we have been schooled and mentored by people who do not\\nknow the Bible and we are captives to the imaginations that has been built\\ninto us and part of the captivity that has been built into us is the fact\\nthat, some traditions has become our expectations, because we believe the\\nthings of the Spirit only manifest in the churches only when we have vigils,\\nnot knowing that those who go up in the spirit during vigils and intensive\\nservices are those who have received and understand fully well how the things\\nof the Spirit work. I am here to tell us there is more to God that we can ever\\nimagine. And there is more to God than our widest and deepest imaginations.\\nThe fact somethings has proved themselves impossible in our lives does not\\nmean they are impossible. I was talking about the meeting I was where my mum\\nwas also, I was about to start the sermon when I heard a whisper behind me\\ntelling me to preach on healing. Alright, I started preaching and I noticed I\\nsaid a lot of things about with God all things are possible. And after the\\nsermon, I made a call to prayers and when I got to her place. Immediately I\\ntouched her hands, from no where, I started crying, I could not believe that\\ndespite all the fasting and prayers she has been doing, she would still be the\\ntype that needs that much kind of prayers. Kenneth Hagin once said, you can be\\nusing a drug, but it is a wrong drug. The fact you use a random drug does not\\nmean you found the right drug, there are billions of drugs that would not cure\\nan ailment. So, please, there is more to God, I am getting to know more of\\nGod, but it all has to do with Heaven and when I say Heaven, I mean open\\nheavens. A lot of followers of Christ are badly under closed heavens. And\\nbelieve me you, there is nothing as worse as a closed heavens and what closed\\nheaven means is basically unanswered prayers, no matter how much prayers you\\noffer, it is zero and the whole thing is visible, yea, thanks for reading my\\nthread, thanks for honouring me, I pray an open heaven over your life, Daniel\\nprayed, (Daniel 10:12-13), Daniel prayed, but there was no answers until the\\n21st day of continued prayers, the worst place to be in life is at a point in\\nlife where you pray and you do not know the mind of God concerning what you\\nprayed about or get a response back from God.

But\\nI'd try to shed some light into it today.Your parents who gave birth to you,\\nknows what you need as their child. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't ask\\nthem for those things if you are yet to see your parents provide them for you.\\nLikewise, taking your requests to God in prayers which He's already aware of,\\nis like a reminder telling Him that He's yet to do this and that in your life.\\nIt is also a means of showing God how serious you are with what you need,\\nrather than just sitting down and hoping manna would fall from heaven. A\\nrelatable or close example is in numbers 14:24 and 30; because of Caleb's zeal\\nfor God, during the time of Moses, God promised Caleb a special inheritance\\namongst the lands the children of Israel were to possess. And after Moses had\\ndied, and Joshua had taken over from Him, Caleb was yet to see his inheritance\\nbeen given to him, So He (Caleb), then went to Joshua and according to what\\nGod hath promised him in the time of moses, asked that it be given to Him\\n(Joshua 14:6) and it was so (Joshua 14:13).God was the one who with His own\\nmouth promised Caleb (through Moses), but Caleb still had to make a reminder\\nto get it. Especially when he wasn't seeing the manifestation of the promise.\\nHad it been Caleb had kept mute, waiting for God to fulfill that promise\\nwithout reminding Him of it, he may not have gotten his inheritance.Also note:\\nit is not that God forget things, but doing this is a way of holding God by\\nHis word spoken concerning your life, so He can fulfill them.And if you are\\nparticular about prayer point 31, it is talking about thanking God (by faith)\\nfor answering each of those prayer points you had prayed.Have I answered you\\nsir?Shalom.\\n\\n\",\n",

I am saddened by the killing of the ambassador\\nbut I do not regret making it,” Nakoula said.He was referring to the killing\\nof U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans in an\\nattack on the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi reportedly by a\\nmob angered by the film.“I am the one who leaked the 14 minutes and put it on\\nthe Internet and I am thinking about releasing the full film. Nobody\\nmanipulated my film,” Nakoula said.Asked if he felt guilty that the violence\\nis being directed against U.S. citizens, Nakoula said: “Yes, I feel guilty.\\nAmerica has nothing to do with this subject and is suffering the consequences\\nof a film that has nothing to do with\\nit.”source:http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/09/15/238201.htmlhttp://images.alarabiya.net/8b/bf/640x392_18215_238201.jpg\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Kanye West Tells Kim Kardashian To Stop Wearing Revealing Dresses, As It\\n‘Affects Him’ As A ChristianHip-hop and fashion trailblazer Kanye West has\\nspoken out against his wife, Kim Kardashian, for wearing revealing dresses in\\npublic, saying that the way she presents herself in public negatively affects\\nhim as a born again Christian.The celebrity couple quarreled on a recent\\nepisode of their show, “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”, after West spoke out\\nagainst Kardashian’s decision to wear revealing clothes in public. However,\\nshe responded that she was on a different path to him.The debate was sparked\\nby Kardashian’s decision to wear a tight-fitting Thierry Mugler dress to the\\n2019 Met Gala Ball. The designer dress had been made in skin colour to give\\nthe impression that she was naked with water dripping down her body.West said\\nto his wife: “I just went through this transition from being a rapper, looking\\nat all these girls and looking at my wife, like, ‘Oh, my girl needs to be just\\nlike the other girls showing her body off’.“I didn’t realize that that was\\naffecting my soul and my spirit as someone that’s married and the father of\\nnow … about to be four kids. A corset is a form of underwear. It’s hot. For\\nwho, though?”West has famously been hosting weekly Sunday Service events\\nthroughout the year, which have attracted thousands of attendants. The events\\nfeature gospel music by West and his band, and more recently, sermons have\\nalso been introduced.Kardashian responded to her husband: “You’re giving me\\nreally bad anxiety. You knew last night I was having really bad anxiety and I\\ndon’t need any more negative energy, for you to say you’re now not into me\\nwearing a tight dress.”To which West replied, “You are my wife, and it affects\\nme when pictures are too sexy.”However, Kardashian retorted: “You built me up\\nto be this sexy person and confidence and all this stuff, and just because\\nyou’re on a journey and transformation doesn’t mean I’m in the same spot with\\nyou,” according to Christian Today.The exchange ended with West simply\\nreplying “OK” before he walked out the room.Popular hip-pop singer, Nicki\\nMinaj, while hosting “Queen Radio” on Apple Music, also revealed that West\\ntold her he turned to God after being hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar\\ndisorder in 2016. She made the announcement during a discussion about faith in\\nthe entertainment industry with special guest Chance The Rapper, who recently\\nwent on a sabbatical to “learn the Word of God.”Pray for Kanye West as he goes\\nthrough this transformation period in his new found faith in Christ Jesus.I\\nbeseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your\\nbodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable\\nservice. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the\\nrenewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,\\nand perfect, will of God. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every\\nman that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to\\nthink; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the\\nmeasure of faith.

Behold,\\nI will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will\\neven make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

We thank God for\\nHis faithfulness despite the challenges of the previous months due to the\\nCovid-19 global pandemic. I want to let you know that the original purposes\\nand promises of God for your life for this year shall fully come to pass, the\\nepidemic notwithstanding. God is ready to give you a whole new beginning in\\nJesus’ Name. The Scripture makes it clear that we serve the God of new\\nbeginning (Gen. 1:1). We serve the God of new things (Isa. 43:19). It has been\\nconfirmed that God proves Himself at the beginning of new phases and seasons\\nof life. This means, one of the attributes of God is that He is the God of new\\nbeginning. In Scriptures, there are instances or places where God proved\\nHimself as the God of new beginning. And we shall consider three of such\\ninstances or places in our study today:1. At Creation (Gen. 1:1-3). Before\\ncreation, the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face\\nof the deep. Everything was disorganised and stood still. And in that\\ncondition, God stepped into the scene and began to manifest His work. Then the\\nearth experienced a new beginning, flourishing in amazing beauty and\\nsplendour.2. In the Life of Samson.When Samson played himself into the hands\\nof his enemies, they shaved off the seven locks of his head (Judges 16:18-19).\\nThe Scripture makes it clear that the hair of his head began to grow again\\nafter he was shaven (Judg. 16:22). God gave Samson a new beginning. 3. In the\\nValley of Dry Bones.Dead and dry bones rose and became an exceeding great army\\nwhen God began and finished His work in the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel\\n37:1-10). You know, the dead and dry bones were people who lived before, but\\ndied, decayed, degenerated, and became dry bones. The Hand of God came upon\\nthem, and they rose and became an exceeding great army. God is indeed the God\\nof new beginnings.Beloved, God might have done certain things in your life\\nbefore but you seem to have lost them. You might have reached a great height\\nin life before, but suddenly, you crashed. Maybe the things that were working\\nin your life before now are no longer working. Today, I decree that the God of\\nnew beginnings will give you a whole new beginning; He will cause your life to\\nblossom and flourish again, in Jesus’ Name.Remember this: God proves Himself\\nat the beginning of new phases and seasons of life.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE Our\\nDaily Bread daily devotional for today hereCLICK HERE TO READ MORE Open\\nHeavens daily devotionals hereCLICK HERE TO READ MORE Mfm Mountain top life\\ndaily devotional hereCLICK HERE TO READ MORE Rhapsody of realities daily\\ndevotional here.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE DCLM daily manna devotional\\nhereASSIGNMENTS:1.

              "  'content': 'religious fanaticism has really made us backward. A progressive life in this\\ncentury is possible only after abandoning it. This is how Europe developed and\\nprogressed..What is it about religious beliefs that people are too intolerant\\nagainst other humans? Does believing in ideologies and writings from some\\nhundred or thousand years ago more important than someone’s current\\nexistence?The picture right there is that of Farkhunda Malikzada.Farkhunda was\\na 27-year-old decent girl, working as a volunteer teacher while she studied\\nIslamic law.Her dream was to find a good husband, start her own family and\\nbecome a judge. She was known to be a brave woman who speaks of her mind.But\\nsometimes life isn\\'t fair.What happened to her shocked her country and made\\nheadlines around the world.This is her complete story: One day, on her way\\nhome, Farkhunda stopped by the Shah-e Du Shamshira shrine, in the centre of\\nKabul. She said her prayers and then got into an argument about the selling of\\ncharms - little scraps of paper bearing Koranic verses.Farkhunda regarded\\nthese as superstitious and un-Islamic (and she\\'s correct - Islam does not\\nallow the use of charms even if they contain Koranic verses). She was trying\\nto make this point to the caretaker at the shrine, Zain-ul-Din, when he began\\nshouting: \"This woman is an American and she has burned the Koran!\"A crowd\\ngathered. Some began to film what happened next on their phones. The footage\\nis extremely disturbing, but people were watching her.Farkhunda, veiled,\\nstands just inside the gate to the shrine, denying that she has burned the\\nKoran.\"The Americans have sent her!\" a man shouts. \"Don\\'t call me American!\"\\nsays Farkhunda. \"If you say anything I will smash your mouth,\" replies the\\nman.\"Don\\'t film me brother,\" pleads Farkhunda. \"It\\'s not filming,\" says the\\nman holding the phone, before adding: \"Why did you burn the Koran? Don\\'t you\\nhave any shame?\"Farkhunda is pulled out from the shrine, pushed to the ground\\nand kicked. \"Kill her!\" comes a cry. Then, after gun shots from the police,\\nthe crowd moves back to reveal a figure sitting upright on the tarmac, her\\nveil and headscarf gone, her hair in disarray and her hands and face red with\\nblood. Dazed, Farkhunda stares up at the camera. One of her shoes has fallen\\noff.\"What pains my heart is when she\\'s sitting like this and her head is\\nbleeding,\" says one who witnessed. \"The police are just standing there. Why\\ndon\\'t they bring a car over, or do something?”.Before long, police gave up\\nattempting to hold the crowd back. Footage shows them watching as Farkhunda is\\nstruck down, kicked, beaten with sticks, and run over with a car that drags\\nher 200m down a street.Farkhunda was thrown to the dry riverbed and large\\nrocks were thrown onto her. After the stoning, Farkhunda\\'s body was set\\nalight, signalling the end of the prolonged attack.Farkhunda was killed on\\nThursday 19th March 2015 in Kabul, Afghanistan.The mobile phone footage of the\\nkilling was soon uploaded and shared on the internet. Many people boasted\\nonline about their role in the attack, or made clear their support.Although\\nPresident Ashraf Ghani condemned the lynching and ordered an investigation,\\nsome officials were quick to endorse it - including the deputy minister of\\ninformation and culture, Semin Ghazal Hasanzada and Kabul police spokesman\\nHashmat Stanekzai. The following day, after Friday prayers, some prominent\\nimams also praised the crowd\\'s actions.Farkhunda\\'s family were told by police\\nto leave Kabul for their own safety.But by the evening of the following day,\\nthe narrative had changed. An investigation by the ministry of Hajj and\\nReligious Affairs found no evidence that Farkhunda had burned the Koran.The\\nimams and officials retracted their statements of support for the lynching,\\nand in time Hasanzada and Stanekzai were sacked.Farkhunda went from being a\\nfigure of loathing to a martyr. More than 1,000 people gathered for her\\nfuneral. In an unprecedented act for a country where burials are often male-\\nonly events, her coffin was carried to the grave by women.\"My friends and I,\\nwe promised each other, \\'We won\\'t let any man touch this coffin,\\'\" says\\nwomen\\'s rights activist Sahra Mosawi. \"They\\'d come forward to carry the coffin\\nand we said, \\'Don\\'t touch it. Where were you that day when 150 men attacked\\nFarkhunda? Where were you?\\'”.Two days later, on 24 March 2015, thousands of\\nwomen and men marched through Kabul, chanting \"We are all Farkhunda!\" and\\ndemanding justice. Some of the protesters painted their faces red to mirror\\nthe image of Farkhunda\\'s bleeding face.Forty-nine men were charged in\\nconnection with the murder.At the televised trial that took place six weeks\\nlater, 11 police officers were sentenced to a year in prison for their failure\\nto defend Farkhunda, eight civilians were given 16-year terms, and four death\\nsentences were handed down. One of those sentenced to death was Zain-ul-Din,\\nthe shrine\\'s caretaker. Another was Yaqoob, the boy in the sunglasses\\nshop.Farkhunda really didn\\'t deserve such an ending. May her soul rest in\\nperfect peace.I have no words to describe the monsters involved in such\\nbrutality.\\n\\n',\n",

Let me shock you\\nall,the name \\'Allah\\' that christains hates to hear,the Arabic word which means\\n\\'God\\' is in the Bible.Christains hates this name because they are ignorant of\\ntruth.The name Allah is available in the Bible,let me prove it:1.In every\\nsingle Bible,there is usually a preface statements that says\\'for God so loved\\nthe world that he gave his only begotten son,that whoever believes in him\\nshall not perish but have eternal life\\' when it was to be translated to\\nArabic,the word \\'God\\'was written as Allah.It can be found in John\\n3:16.Christains should remember that the Bible is actually in Ibru,it was only\\ntranslated to English;a language where the creator is referred as\\nGod.2.Everytime the word God appears in an english Bible,it is translated as\\nAllah in Arabic. Now let me educate christains on why We muslims don\\'t use the\\nword\\'God\\' to address Allah:Christains have forgotten that Arabic is an\\ninternational language spoken by more than 20 countries of the world as their\\nlocal dialect unlike English which is only spoken by two as their local\\ndialect.In present day world,genius human beings in their respective fields\\nare called God e.g Lionel Messi is the God of football,but I wonder why people\\nwould still use the same word for the true God \\'Allah\\' when Messi who was\\npresent on the field of play when his Barcelona team were white watched by\\nBayern munich 7-0 on aggregate back in 2013 is being called,then that word\\n\\'God\\'is too low to address the Almighty creator,that why the perfect word for\\nHim is Allah and that is an English translated Qur\\'an would still translates\\nAllah as Allah.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Does The Bible Say A Rape Victim Must Marry Her Rapist?JULY 6, 2020Ray\\nComfortFounder & CEO, Living Waters“Where is, ‘Thou shalt not rape’…?” —Pat\\nC., Facebook questionWhile the Bible doesn’t say, “Thou shalt not rape” in the\\nTen Commandments, it is summed up in the essence of the moral Law, which says\\nto love your neighbour as yourself. Love does not rape.Hebrew criminal law\\nconsidered rape such a serious crime that rapists were to be put to death:“But\\nif a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie\\nwith her: then the man only that lay with her shall die” (Deuteronomy 22:25,\\nKJV).Yet there are some who believe that the Scriptures say that the victim of\\nthe rapist had to marry him. He wasn’t to be punished, but to be rewarded with\\nthe woman as his prize. Here is the verse used to justify that belief:“If a\\nman find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and LAY HOLD ON\\nHER, and lie with her, and they be found; Then the man that lay with her shall\\ngive unto the damsel’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his\\nwife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his\\ndays”(Deuteronomy 22:28-29, KJV, caps added).Unbelievably, (in the light of\\nthe previous verse saying that a rapist was to be put to death) a number of\\nmodern translations interpret “lay hold on her” as rape.The Hebrew word\\n“tapas” means to “take hold of something,” to grasp it in hand, and (by\\napplication) to capture or seize something.In Genesis 4:21, it used for\\n“handling” the flute.If a man raped a woman, he was to be put to death.\\nKilled. That means he is dead (no longer alive), and a dead man can’t marry\\nthe woman he raped. He can’t marry her because he’s dead.So for those who can\\nfigure out that dead men don’t marry women, coupled with the fact that the\\nverse says “if THEY be found,” implying both were guilty, this verse obviously\\nrefers to consensual sex.It’s similar to what we nowadays call a “shotgun”\\nwedding. They had to get married.Source\\n\\n',\n",

This case is the same as when one man attacks another man\\nand murders him. 27 The man raped the engaged woman in the countryside, and\\nalthough she cried for help, there was no one to help her.This sex is not\\nconsensual and is thus termed rape. The man only is to be put to death here.\\nIt is stated clearly in verse 27 that God gives the death sentence to\\nrapists.karo93:28 “Suppose a man is caught raping a young woman who is not\\nengaged. 29 He is to pay her father the bride price of fifty pieces of silver,\\nand she is to become his wife, because he forced her to have intercourse with\\nhim. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.GNBThe authorised version\\ngot it right here. It says:\"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is\\nnot betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; Then\\nthe man that lay with her shall give to the damsel\\'s father fifty shekels of\\nsilver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put\\nher away all his days\" (Deuteronomy 22:28-29).This is what is called a shotgun\\nwedding. You can see from the verses above that it was consensual here. They\\nwere caught in the act (they were found). The fact that the lady did not raise\\nan alarm shows that that they were having consensual sex with the man not\\nwilling to commit to a life time commitment in marriage. He was enjoying the\\nbenefit of marriage without committing to marriage. If they are caught the man\\nis obligated to a shotgun wedding. Wedding by force, as you may.\\nwww.nairaland.com/attachments/9891603_shotgunmarriage_jpegff3f69d24c556f6e8cc9e5b5b89c7e69\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': '3 Reasons Everybody Needs CommunityBy Rick WarrenGod never intended for anyone\\nto walk through life alone. He made us for each other, and he wants us all to\\nbelong to his forever family.One of sin’s effects on the human race has been\\nthe separation from God and from other people that we all experience. From\\nAdam onward, we’ve all had the tendency to hide in shame.But there is help,\\nnot only from the redemptive work God accomplished through his Son, Jesus, but\\nalso in the form of other people.Part of your healing will always be found in\\nthe context of healthy community.The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 4:9-10, “Two\\npeople are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. If one\\nperson falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is\\nin real trouble” (NLT).These verses teach about the principle of mutuality,\\nand there are three significant needs met in our lives by the mutuality of\\nbiblical community.First, we all need mutual accountability.In other words,\\nyou need a prayer partner. You check in on each other and support one another\\nin your spiritual journey.Not everything you do in a small group has to\\ninvolve everybody. It’s very easy, and even advisable, to pair up sometimes\\nwithin a small group.If you have a prayer partner who is checking up on you\\nand you’re checking up on them, you’re going to grow faster than if you don’t\\nhave anybody encouraging you.Second, we all need mutual\\nencouragement.Ephesians 4:29 says, “Let everything you say be good and\\nhelpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them”\\n(NLT).Once during a service, as I was leading the closing prayer, a woman\\nburst into tears. She was sobbing uncontrollably, very, very loudly—about 10\\nrows from the back. Everything in me wanted to jump off that stage, run down\\nto that woman, give her a hug, pray with her, and help her.Had I done so, the\\nentire room full of people would have been focusing their attention on us, and\\nthat might have been far too intense for her.Thankfully, I didn’t have to do\\nthat. All the people around this woman covered her with love. It was\\nspontaneous and instant. That’s a kind of encouragement only a community of\\nloving people can provide.Third, we all need mutual honoring.Romans 12:10\\nsays, “Love each other with genuine affection, and take delight in honoring\\neach other” (NLT).One of the most powerful exercises any small group of\\nbelievers can go through is the practice of having the group focus on one\\nperson at a time and asking each person to express something about that\\nindividual that is appreciated.Obviously, we can do this outside the context\\nof a small group, too, but the point is that it’s a need we all have—to honor\\nand to be honored.The fact is, there are real, deep needs that God intends to\\nmeet in your life using other people. Accountability, encouragement, and honor\\nall come from the words and actions of a community of people.If you want\\nhealing, connect with God for redemption, and connect with others for\\nencouragement.\\n\\n',\n",

He travels around the\\nworld, relying on strangers to provide him with food, gas, and a place to\\nstay. Then he rewards them, through his organization, with good deeds such as\\nfeeding orphans or building on to a school for underprivileged children. He\\nsays, “It’s sometimes seen as being soft.

Why they would flaw government\\nstipulated directives to curtail the spread of this dangerous incurable\\nvirus.A lady explained What really happened in Christ Embassy Church in Akwa\\nIbom before it was shut down. A look at the sitting arrangement shows the\\nchurch complied with the social/physical distancing rule. (PHOTS BELOW)The\\nnews of the Church being shut down in Akwa Ibom state has caused a lot of\\nreactions from people online.After the statement was released by government\\nofficials, many people explained what really happened at the church last\\nSunday.This leads to a lady who is the confirmed member of the church opens up\\non what really happened after the news was all over media.The Management\\ncommittee of Covid19 issued a statement on sunday that a church, which was\\nconfirmed to be Christ Embassy church founded by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is\\nsealed by the committee, because the church did not obey the rules and\\nregulations or protocols of covid-19, precisely social distancing in Akwa\\nIbom.The government official said in a statement that when CAN and convid-19\\ncommittee member visited the church, they discovered that they have obstructed\\nthe laws set by different organisation to prevent the spread of the virus. So\\nthey have to close the church. A look at the covid-19 enforcement team showed\\nthey were the ones that defiled the social distancing rule.However, as I said\\nearlier when the news was out, a Lady explained that what the Secretary said\\nis not totally true .She said that she was there when the whole thing started\\nand the information was not accurate. She said the policemen were the ones\\nthat came and even start attacking the members of the church.She further\\nexplained that police even slapped one of the media crew members and collected\\nhis camera so that he will not view the whole scene.She further emphasized\\nthat the policemen were the ones showing violence. This was what she said\\nafter she read the letter from Emmanuel Ekuwem: \"liars, I was in that church\\ntoday, the church obeyed the guidelines and your policemen that were with the\\ntask force were the ones showing violence. A policeman slapped a member of the\\nmedia team and took his camera from him.

Our religion\\nis not to be confined to our closet; we must carry out into practical effect\\nthat which we believe. If a man walks in Christ, then he so acts as Christ\\nwould act; for Christ being in him, his hope, his love, his joy, his life, he\\nis the reflex of the image of Jesus; ” Walking signifies progress. “So walk ye\\nin him”; proceed from grace to grace, run forward until you reach the\\nuttermost degree of knowledge that a man can attain concerning our Beloved.\\nWalking implies continuance. There must be a perpetual abiding in Christ. Let\\nme give you seven steps I believe Jesus wants us to walk in:1. Walk in Wisdom\\n- Col. 4:5-6\"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time.\\nLet your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know\\nhow you ought to answer every man.2. Walk Honestly - 1 Thess. 4:12\"That you\\nmay walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of\\nnothing.\"3. Walk in the Light - John 8:12\" I am the light of the world; he\\nthat follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of\\nlife.\"4. Walk Carefully - Eph. 5:15See then that you walk carefully, not as\\nfools but as wise,5. Walk in newness of life - Rom. 6:4\"Therefore we are\\nburied with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from\\nthe dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also walk in newness of\\nlife.\"6. Walk by Faith - II Corinthians 5:7\"For we walk by faith, not by\\nsight.\"7. Walk in the Spirit - Gal. 5:16\"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit,\\nand you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.\"How many Christians think\\nthat in the morning and evening they ought to come into the company of Jesus,\\nand may then give their hearts to the world all the day; we should always be\\nwith him, treading in his steps and doing his will. “As ye have received\\nChrist Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him”.HymnWhen we walk with the lordIn the\\nlight of his wordWhat a glory He sheds on our way!While we do His good will,He\\nabides with us still,And with all who will trust and obeyTrust and obey, for\\nthere\\'s noother wayTo be happy in Jesus,But to trust and obey2. Not a shadow\\ncan rise,Not a cloud in the skies,But His smile quickly drives it away;Not a\\ndoubt nor a fearNot a sigh nor a tear,Can abide while we trust andobey.3. Not\\na burden we bear,Not a sorrow we shareBut our toil he doth richly repay;Not a\\ngrief nor a loss,Not a frown nor a cross,But is blest if we trust and obey.4.\\nBut we never can proveThe delights of His loveUntil all on the alter we\\nlay;For the favour He shows,And the joy he bestows,Are for them who will trust\\nandobey.5. Then in fellowship sweetWe will sit at His feet,Or we\\'ll walk by\\nHis side in theway;What He says we will doWhere He sends we will goNever fear,\\nonly trust and obey.Amen.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'THE E.B. GBONIGI THAT YOU PROBABLY DO NOT KNOWBy: Ifeoluwa OrimoloyeI was only\\nabout 10 years old when I had my first memorable encounter with Rt. Reverend\\n(Dr) Emmanuel Bolanle Gbonigi, the then Lord Bishop of Akure (Anglican)\\nDiocese. He was the pioneer Bishop of that Diocese between the year 1983-2000.\\nOn this particular occasion, I was playing football as was the usual routine\\nwith Boys of my age when his car pulled up in front of our family apartment at\\nOndo road. He looked simple but had an air of grace around him. As I inched\\ntowards the car, he asked after grandma and the rest of the family. There was\\nnobody at home and so he asked further, “Do you know me?”I remember that I\\nreplied by mentioning the full names and his title as it appears in the Church\\nbulletin at that time. He was quite amazed at the fact that a youngster like\\nme could mention his name the way I did. Fifteen years later, Baba would later\\ninspire me to champion the birth of the Youth wing of the Yoruba Unity\\nForum.My Grandpa (who died about thirty years ago today) and Bishop Gbonigi\\nattended the popular Meville Hall, now Immanuel College of Theology, Ibadan.\\nApparently, their relationship started from the clergy school and ever since\\nthey became families. By the time grandpa departed away from the troubles of\\nthis world, Baba took charge and became more like a father to the children. He\\nis the type that the Yoruba would refer to as a dependable ally, who\\ndemonstrated during and after grandpa’s existence the kind of friendship that\\nis expected of human creatures.It seemed like grandpa encountered so many\\nchallenges in the course of discharging his duties such that he found\\ncompanionship in some of his fellow clergies including Baba. Granpa’s\\nexperience in the ministry is a story for another day.The real motivation for\\nputting this up is Baba Bishop’s exemplary life. I remember putting it up\\nelsewhere that I revere people who, outside their usual duties do\\nextraordinary exploits for humanity. I remember mentioning the names like that\\nof Professor Soyinka. So it is with Baba, who some people refer to as the\\n“Desmond Tutu of Nigeria.” Grandma once told me the story of how a certain\\nwealthy politician visited Baba in his Office attempting to influence him with\\na cash gift and how Baba rebuffed it and even other attempts to get him to\\nreceive the money. That is the extent of Baba’s integrity.Even as a priest and\\na leader of the Church of Nigeria (Akure Diocese), he acted as a democrat and\\nwithout fear resisted oppression in the days of the military incursion into\\nour democracy. Baba is one of the heroes of this generation not just because\\nof his exploits as an activist or as a priest but because of his exemplary\\nlifestyle which is further exemplified by people who have had an encounter\\nwith him.Today, I pray for God’s grace upon Baba’s life so that he could\\ncontinue to be an ambassador of humanity. However, whenever Baba gets the call\\nto return home, one thing for which I am sure is that he would have left so\\nmany Bishop Gbonigis in this world; a descendent of honest and exemplary\\ngenerations who will continue to advance the cause of humanity.\\n\\n',\n",

Midori\\nAlbert, a professor who teaches forensic anthropology at the University of\\nNorth Carolina at Wilmington. Experts in this highly specialized field require\\na working knowledge of genetics, and human growth and development. In their\\nresearch they also draw from the fields of primatology, paleoanthropology (the\\nstudy of primate and human evolution) and human osteology (the study of the\\nskeleton). Even seemingly distant fields like nutrition, dentistry and climate\\nadaptation play a role in this type of investigation. While forensic\\nanthropology is usually used to solve crimes, Richard Neave, a medical artist\\nretired from The University of Manchester in England, realized it also could\\nshed light on the appearance of Jesus. The co-author of Making Faces: Using\\nForensic And Archaeological Evidence , Neave had ventured in controversial\\nareas before. Over the past two decades, he had reconstructed dozens of famous\\nfaces, including Philip II of Macedonia, the father of Alexander the Great,\\nand King Midas of Phrygia. If anyone could create an accurate portrait of\\nJesus, it would be Neave.... .. read more and the picture >>>\\nhttps://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a234/1282186/\\n\\n',\n",

God want his people to have an attitude of I will\\nnot worry for the sake of God. As a Christian do not worry because you have a\\nGod who is caring, He is the good Shepherd that take good cares of his\\nflocks.Instead of worrying get down on your kneel, pray to God, tell God that\\nproblem that is making you to worry, ask God to help you and to rescue you\\nfrom your suffering and believe without doubt and fear in your mind that God\\nwill give you victory over your trouble. The God who answer prayers will hear\\nyour prayer and will send help and deliverance into your Life.Worrying is not\\ngood for your Christian life, and it can hinder your blessings from God. When\\nyou are worrying you can’t concentrate on what you do. Worrying makes you make\\nmistakes which you could have been avoided if you were not worrying. Worry can\\nweaken you from praying to God if you allow it. But I am telling you today\\nthat you have a Mighty God who can rescue you from that worries, all you have\\nto do is to seek the help of God through prayer and fasting. Never give up, do\\nnot be discourage, God is aware of your suffering and he is sending help your\\nway. It will not be long, your trouble shall be a thing of the past. Just\\nbelieve in Jesus Christ as your Messiah and in God as the one who exist and\\nreward those who diligently seek him. Turn away from your evil and begin to do\\nthe right thing always. Do good things, do those things that show that you\\nhave repented from your sins. If you have food, share it with those who do not\\nhave food to eat. If you have two clothes, give one to the person who doesn't\\nhave one. Stop stealing, do not murder anyone, do not commit adultery, stop\\ngossiping, help the poor and stop doing evil. You can also overcome your\\nworries by asking your fellow Christians, Church members to assist you in\\nprayer.MATTHEW 18 : 19“And I tell you more: whenever two of you on earth agree\\nabout anything you pray for, it will be done for you by Father in heaven.You\\ncan ask your fellow brothers and sisters in Christ to assist and pray with you\\nconcerning the trouble you are facing. There is power in prayer. Pray every\\nday with the following Scripture chapters; psalms 9, psalms 70, psalms 91,\\npsalms 121, and psalms 138. Do not be discourage and afraid. Stop worrying\\nbecause of the suffering you are passing through just have faith in God, pray\\nand believe that by the help of God everything will be alright again.Pray with\\nthis prayer below ;PRAYERMy Father in heaven, I thank and praise you for your\\nlove which cares for me. Have mercy on me God, forgive all my sins and make me\\nholy again. Help me Lord and deliver me from all my worries.

Our brothers were\\nbusy arguing with christians about the age of our Mother Aisha (R.A) and many\\nof us can\\'t defend ourselves on this issue. Let me make it clear. While the\\ndisbelievers are busy calling HIM (The Holy Prophet, Sallallahu alaihi\\nwasallam) a Pedophile, the Muslims were busy faulting Sahih Bukhari so as to\\n\"cover-up\" the issue. What an error!!!The aged were like: that\\'s\\nextremism.Aisha (RadiAllahu Anha) said, \"I was given in marriage to the\\nRasuulullah (SAW) when I was 6yrs old, and he consummated the marriage when I\\nwas 9\"(Bukhari).Rather than calling it a da\\'eef hadith, to please your non-\\nMuslim friends who are insulting our Rasoolullah (SAW), just be silent, or ask\\nthe scholars and read more about Seeroh and perhaps Allah may grant you the\\nHikmah (Wisdom) behind it. Don\\'t just give answer based on your whimsical\\nignorance, the same way you condemned Sufism without a single knowledge of\\nIslam.Have you ever asked yourselfWhy is it that during the days of Quraysh,\\nthey called the Rasulullah (SAW)Magician, Madman, and the likes but NEVER\\ncalled him a Pedophile if this accusation was true?They never raised any\\nquestion about his marriage to Aisha (R.A). Why? Because it was NORMAL at that\\ntime. Girls at that age were suitable for marriage at that time.Let me give\\nyou the following proof:1. Saint Augustine (350AD) married a 10 year old\\ngirl!.2. King Richard 11 (1400AD) married a 7yr old girl.3.King Henry VIII\\n(1500AD) he married a 5yr old girl.Even in the BIBLE it says:....But save for\\nyourself every girl who has never slept with a man (Numbers 31.\\n17:28).According to the Catholic encyclopedia,Mary the mother of Jesus was 12\\nwhen she married the 99 years old Joseph!!! \"This was based on their\\nthought\"Before 1929, Church of England ministers could marry 12yrs old girls\\nin Britain.Up till 1983, Catholic Canon laws permitted priests to marry off\\nbrides at the age of 12.In the United States, back in 1880, in the state of\\nDelaware, the minimum age for marriage was 7yrs and in California it was\\n10!!!So Aisha (RadiAllahu Anha) was NOT a child when she was married!We live\\nin a society where good is condemned at every slight opportunity but evil is\\nencouraged even when its flaws are crystal clear.How strangeThe Nigerian\\nconstitution says:An 18yrs old can voteAn 18yrs old can go to jailAn 18yrs old\\ncan contest for political positionsAn 18yrs old can travel outside d country\\nall alone.And YET, an 18yrs old can\\'t marry?But our 12yrs old Girls are having\\nboyfriends !Do you know?When Sofiyyah bint Huyay was married to Prophet\\nMuhammed (SAW), she was just 17yrs old? And that was her THIRD marriage. She\\nwas initially married to Salam ibn abi Haqiq and later to Kinanah ibn abi\\nHaqiq!, Imagine how old she was during her first marriage?Are you clarified\\nnow?Those still doubtful, Go back to your village and ask your grandmother how\\nold she was when she got married!*Islam is perfect while Muslims may not*May\\nAllah (SWT) always give us ability to overcome every challenges in this life\\nand the hereafter.Ameeen.\\n\\n',\n",

This junction has various names and varies , some are called roadblock, challenge and despair, breakthrough,success etc. A junction could mean a major point in life , where notable event occurred in our life, for some it is marriage, graduation, retirement etc.In our bible reading of today, ten lepers were cleansed, but only one came back to appreciate God for his goodness. A quick statistics of that event reveals , that is the attitude of all human beings. Only 1 out of 10, came back to thank God , that is 10 % which is a surprise.The man who came back to appreciate got to a junction, called appreciation and he looked at his body and he saw the difference, and he turned back and gave thanks. And because of his thanksgiving , his blessing was doubled. Others got healing as a blessing, but he was made whole(Luke 19vs 19) . To be healed is good , to be made whole is better.Beloveth , which of the two category do you belong ? Do you often thank God ? Or complain that what you have is not enough?

We are not a church, but a\\ngroup, a team. Our principal objective is to win souls into the kingdom of\\nGod. We are achieving this objective through preaching the raw, undiluted,\\nlife transforming gospel messages of our Lord Jesus Christ to all the world\\n(Mk. 16:15) and counseling and prayers for the needy (Jn. 17:9).Our major\\nconcern here to which we are drawing your attention is the Counseling And\\nPrayers For The Needy Program. To start with, everyone in this earth, at one\\ntime or the other would have a need, in one form or the other. The big\\nbillionaires you see in the society today have various needs which their money\\ncan’t solve for them. Do you doubt this? Well, when you go close to them, you\\nwill know. The ‘needy’ here is not restricted to the financially poor people.\\nAnybody at anytime can be in need in any form. For the purpose of this\\nmessage, you are in need if you are confronted with a problem and the problem\\nhas refused to go despite all your personal efforts and all the human efforts\\nof the people you have contacted for help. For instance, you could have a need\\nfor something and you do your best to solve the problem but it remains\\nunmoved. You contact all people known to you whom you believe from experience\\ncan help bring the solution, yet no solution. The need can be anything, just\\nanything. Now, beloved, if you find yourself in a need which your personal\\nefforts and all the efforts of people you know have refused/failed to bring\\nthe solution, what do you do? Surrender and live miserably with the problem?\\nNo! I want to announce to you that the Lord God Almighty whom we serve, the\\ncreator of heaven and earth, is able, willing and ready to give you the\\nsolution you are looking for. All human efforts have failed. Yes! God is going\\nto use that your matter to prove to you that He is God and that nothing is\\nimpossible for Him to do. (Lk. 1:37; Lk. 18:27; Job 42:2) This is where our\\n‘counseling and prayers for the needy program’ comes in. When you have a need\\nwhich has refused to give way despite all your efforts and the efforts of all\\ncontacts you know, with due respect, we would want you to let us know about\\nthe matter. We will present the matter to God during our prayer programs. God\\nshall answer the prayer, set you free from the problem and put joy in your\\nheart. (Matt.7:7-8; Matt. 21:22; Mk. 11:24; Isa. 61:10) We know what our God\\nhas been doing and can do and will continue to do. It is God’s good pleasure\\nto solve your problems and put joy in your heart. (Ps. 35:27; Lk. 12:32) Now,\\nget this information clear: God is drawing souls to Himself through miracles,\\nsigns and wonders. (Dan. 3:26-30; Dan. 6:20-28; Jn. 6:1-2; Acts 2:41; Acts\\n4:4) As the problem is confronting you, you have concluded that it is\\nunsolvable, but God will solve it for you and in the process, draw you and\\nmany others into His kingdom.Having read the above, we want you to do as\\nfollows:(1) When you have a need (as explained above), send us an email,\\nexplaining clearly the problem and the solution you desire. In the email,\\nstate your full names, telephone numbers and full contact address.

It will also Shock my Reader for the first time, especially the\\nChristians that going back to the Bible again and again will be vital, the\\ndiscovery who christ was will be made paramouth. In Palestine at that time,\\nthe Name of the Great White Brotherhood was Called the Sect of Essenes, for\\nthey were mainly Aramaic, Heathens, and Aryans from Hamoth.The Perfect\\nLinks.Great White Brotherhood - Mystery School of Mount Carmel - Essenes -\\nAncient and Mystic Order of Rosae Crucis. With this Links, the Adept will turn\\nto find the true picture of the mystry school in our contemporary time.Alot of\\nPeople today see AMORC in different perspective, and it is no doubt that some\\nothers join the Order for seeming wealth, due to what information that has\\nbeen gathered over time. The Order is not involved in some ritualistic money\\nmaking machine, It is concerned with Discovering the God-Persons, the Teaching\\nof the so many great Avatars (Sons Of God) that has ascended into the heights\\nof many planes, and has illuminated to become free Souls in the Gathering of\\nthe evolving pureness of the Monotheistic pictures of the one true God. In the\\nTeaching of the Great Avatars, it is known from ages right from the days of\\nThothmes III, the Founder of the great dynasty of Egypt, and the Great Grand\\nFather of Akhanaton, another Son of God in its time. The Aim of the AMORC is\\nto use this teachings to master the true service to Humanity, and the\\nattainment of great service. Jesus - (Joseph) also made use of these Mystery\\nschool ( this will shock my Readers), Yes, he was a great Student and a\\nTeachers of the Great White Brotherhood, Udraka - A Great Hindu Healer one of\\nJoseph - Jesus Teachers/Master in India - Jagannath (present day Puri)\\nTeachers, made mentioned about the wonders and the many tribulations (Drinking\\nfrom the Bitter Water), the Master Jesus was face with. So many other sons of\\nGod before Christ used this Knowledge the AMORC have today to provide\\nundiluted services to humanity through healings, and other numerous services\\nto Humanity. When you seek this first in your inner consciousness, then\\nwealth, and blessings of Karma itself will rush to you, and you will be\\nfamous, whatever you want. Master Jesus said so himself. Seek ye first the\\nKingdom of God, and every other thing will be added. We Must seek to discover\\nour inner connections, help humanity and be free from the curses and\\nimplications of Karma. I don\\'t know what the Author of the \"Prisoner of San\\nJose\" did discovered, but whatever potency had did decide to allure was best\\nknown to him and his readers. In the life of the many evolved and Asscended\\nMasters, there is a four Cardinal Point and this is Justice, Faith, Truth and\\nLove. When one posseses this in our contemporary time. Then As a true Travel\\nof light, truth and love, your soul will be open to the very pureness of\\nheavens, gifts - Wealth and Fame will be accosted to you. Only the true\\nTraveler knows whence they go, and whence they come. In the Rosicrucian\\nRecords, Many Discovery of the World today where amazingly done by those who\\nwere Students of this same Order. Alexandria Graham Bell - Founder of\\nTelephone, Albert Eisten, Michael Faraday Electricity, Rene Descartes - Father\\nof Modern Philosophy, Francis Becon, President Franklin Rossevet, Abraham\\nLincoln, Isaac Newton, Henry Becquare - X-ray to name but a few. They made use\\nof the Sound Information contained in the Sacred Archives of AMORC from old\\nage presentation, and this unfoldment was responsible for distinguished Men\\nand Women in the Society to prove worthy to be of service to humanity, and\\nthey were in their own time and places. In Contemporary Africa, Zik, Awo, Bola\\nIge etc have been distingiushed, and were all of service to humanity.The\\nRosicrucians is not some occult as you call it. With the exemplary defination\\ngiven by one contributor in this forum, it is true of what he said about Cult\\nand Order, as they are same in some parlance, but different in syntax and the\\nactual use of the word in Rosicrucian Meanings and Language.More will be Said\\nwith the Questions that will be raised.\\n\\n',\n",

But imposing the payment of\\nold-covenant TITHING, FIRST-FRUITS, monetary seeds and other Church-themed\\nFEES while they are perhaps terribly indebted!I\\'ve found that God just hands\\nus over to our lusts, what we REALLY want; to be pleasing to Him or Ourselves\\nand Men: Do you want earthly prosperity MORE than heavenly things?Sure, God\\nwill ALLOW the devil to FOOL you by his Great Pastors/Prophets/Church founders\\nand others \"black and blue\".Alas, I reckon that to many, God has already been\\nSECRETLY WARNING them about the Errors or Lies of their Churches; gradually\\nbacksliding Pastors/Prophets/Church founders, who don\\'t care about\\nDISOBEDIENCE to the Words of Jesus. But like Balaam, the backslidden Prophet,\\nthey would do ANYTHING to deceive for Money and everything concerning EARTHLY\\n\"prosperity\" and honour of Men (POPULARITY with the World).If the opinions of\\nmen: Pastors, Elders, Parents and others are MORE IMPORTANT to us than Jesus\\',\\nthen we can\\'t be His disciples nor be part of his kingdom either. And NEITHER\\nbe able to overcome things of these Last days and the coming TRIBULATION.Like\\nsaying, \"If I take this stand, what will my Daddy, Mummy, Pastors and Friends\\nSAY?Rubbish! I respect ALL, BUT I couldn\\'t \"Care Less\" what they say or think\\nabout my taking a stand for the Truth: Jesus.I love all Men, but I wouldn\\'t\\nIDOLIZE or WORSHIP anyone and their opinions. Nor would I appreciate anyone\\nwho desires to WORSHIP me instead of Jesus.We\\'ve got to set things right by\\nRepenting of Sins, FORGIVING OTHERS, paying ALL DEBTS (not just some), and the\\nlikes to please and GIVE ACCEPTABLY to God, not just wasting resources to FAKE\\nReligious MEN and others.God wants every part of our lives: Spirit, Soul and\\nBody to be Holy and acceptable to Him, not just some parts, money, and\\nreligious sacrifices or church activities here and there.Matt.5.23 -\\n\"Therefore, if you are OFFERING your gift at the altar and there REMEMBER that\\nyour brother has something AGAINST YOU,Matt.5.24 - LEAVE YOUR GIFT THERE in\\nfront of the altar.

Never a disease\\nJesus cannot cure! To God’s power, nothing is impossible...

              "  'content': 'Interesting Read, excerpt:Most of the misconceptions about Neanderthal man\\nresulted from the claims of the Frenchman Marcelin Boule who, in 1908, studied\\ntwo Neanderthal skeletons that were found in France (LeMoustier and La\\nChapelle-aux- Saints). Boule declared Neanderthal men to be anatomically and\\nintellectually inferior brutes who were more closely related to apes than\\nhumans. He asserted that they had a slumped posture, a “monkey-like”\\narrangement of certain spinal vertebrae, and he even claimed that their feet\\nwere of a “grasping type” (like those of gorillas and chimpanzees). Boule\\nconcluded that Neanderthal man could not have walked erectly, but rather must\\nhave walked in a clumsy fashion. These highly biased and inaccurate views\\nprevailed and were even expanded by many other evolutionists up to the\\nmid-1950s.In 1957, the anatomists William Straus and A.J. Cave examined one of\\nthe French Neanderthals (La Chapelle-aux-Saints) and determined that the\\nindividual suffered from severe arthritis (as suggested by Virchow nearly 100\\nyears earlier), which had affected the vertebrae and bent the posture. The jaw\\nalso had been affected. These observations are consistent with the Ice Age\\nclimate in which Neanderthals had lived. They may well have sought shelter in\\ncaves, and this, together with poor diet and lack of sunlight, could easily\\nhave led to diseases that affect the bones, such as rickets.In addition to\\nanatomical evidence, there is a growing body of cultural evidence for the\\nfully human status of Neanderthals. They buried their dead and had elaborate\\nfuneral customs that included arranging the body and covering it with flowers.\\nThey made a variety of stone tools and worked with skins and leather. A wood\\nflute was recently discovered among Neanderthal remains. There is even\\nevidence that suggests that Neanderthals engaged in medical care. Some\\nNeanderthal specimens show evidence of survival to old age despite numerous\\nwounds, broken bones, blindness, and disease. This suggests that these\\nindividuals were cared for and nurtured by others who showed human\\ncompassion.Still, efforts continue to be made to somehow dehumanize\\nNeanderthal man. Many evolutionists now even insist that Neanderthal man is\\nnot even directly related to modern man because of some differences in a small\\nfragment of DNA! There is, in fact, nothing about Neanderthals that is in any\\nway inferior to modern man. One of the world’s foremost authorities on\\nNeanderthal man, Erik Trinkaus, concludes: “Detailed comparisons of Neandertal\\nskeletal remains with those of modern humans have shown that there is nothing\\nin Neandertal anatomy that conclusively indicates locomotor, manipulative,\\nintellectual, or linguistic abilities inferior to those of modern\\nhumans.”3ConclusionWhy then are there continued efforts to make apes out of\\nman and man out of apes? In one of the most remarkably frank and candid\\nassessments of the whole subject and the methodology of paleoanthropology, Dr.\\nDavid Pilbeam (a distinguished professor of anthropology) suggested the\\nfollowing:Perhaps generations of students of human evolution, including\\nmyself, have been flailing about in the dark; that our data base is too\\nsparse, too slippery, for it to be able to mold our theories. Rather the\\ntheories are more statements about us and ideology than about the past.\\nPaleoanthropology reveals more about how humans view themselves than it does\\nabout how humans came about.SOURCE\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'I don\\'t know what\\'s happening now that Nairaland characters are now featuring\\nmy dreams. First it was \"Lordreed\". This time around it\\'s \"Missyajoke\" and\\n\"Petra1\". I can\\'t remember all the details of the dream at this point though,\\nso I\\'m just going to share the part I\\'m able to remember, and when more\\ndetails come I would update this post as fitting.What I could remember is that\\nwe found ourselves in a place where danger appeared to be looming, i think\\npeople with intent to attack us approaching closer to where we were. All of a\\nsudden out of nowhere, there came something like a whirlwind or a mighty hand\\nto lift us up from that place to a place so far from where any of them or the\\ndanger could reach us. We could see them behind us but it seems there was kind\\nof hedge or restriction which seemed to prevent them from crossing over unto\\nthe other side we were, as they just stood there watching us helplessly.That\\nwhirlwind or so was one of the highlights of the dream, another was an image\\nof someone that hovered over the sky around where those people behind us were\\nstanding. It appeared feminine in nature, and from the description of Lucifer\\nin the Bible I would assume that it was him because appearance of that person\\nappears to match that description.There were just five of us there who were\\ncarried by the whirlwind or whatever it was, but I can only recall the dream\\nnames of two of the others. One was Missyajoke while the other was Petra1. And\\nnot just they bore the same names with the nairaland monikers but some\\nsentiments of nairaland was strangely also playing out in the dream as I could\\nvividly remember finding it very surprising that @petra1 was also there with\\nus, because he was someone I didn\\'t see eye to eye with on several issues in\\nnairaland, so I didn\\'t expect him to be there. As for @Missyajoke, prior to\\nhaving this dream, there was a thread she made of recent titled, \"Don\\'t be\\nleft behind\\'. When I checked out the thread to see the details, I saw it had\\nto do with the rapture, warning people to be prepared so they do not get left\\nbehind. And I absolutely loved it because I love such messages of repentance\\nand which urges people to turn away from their wicked ways and back to God.\\nHowever I saw that despite that several people had already commented on the\\nthread and that it had even reached the second page I think, that the post\\nhadn\\'t yet gotten any likes or shares. So i was the first to like and share\\nit.I also observed that a serious argument was ensuring on the thread about\\nthe rapture, whether it would take place or not and how it was going to take\\nplace, so I thought about it for a bit because I confess, i\\'m not very\\nacquainted with matters concerning the rapture. I\\'m more of an \"always be\\nprepared\\' person, so that even if Jesus comes today, I\\'d be ready. So it\\ndoesn\\'t matter to me whether there would be rapture or no rapture, but to\\nalways watch and be my toes which I thought was the best approach...so that\\none would not be caught unawares. And I wanted to make a comment in that\\nrespect but I later decided not to.But I still had a brief thought about it,\\nand remembered that Jesus said something about two people being in one place\\nand one taken and the other left behind. And when His disciples asked Him,\\n\"where Lord?\" He said, \"where the carcass is, the eagles would be gathered\\ntogether.\" Luke 17:34-37So that\\'s probably where @missyajoke came into the\\npicture, as the dream reflected the message of her thread about the rapture\\nand being left behind.I can\\'t say for sure what this dream means, but since it\\nhad to do with the \"rapture\", it may be a warning sign from heaven that the\\ntime is indeed that close, so do not say you weren\\'t warned!God bless Nigeria.\\n\\n',\n",

The verdict of God over him affected\\nall men who were born after him. There is no man who disobeyed God be it\\ndeliberately or not that did not invite curse on him or herself. Majority of\\nthe problems in the world today was because of the fact that men chose not to\\nobey God.

A man can\\nonly have freedom from the grip of sin when he chooses to expose it. Every\\nguilt and act of blackmail thrives on covered sin.Sin of the past will always\\nthreaten our present and also aim to destroy our future. When Achan stole what\\nwas dedicated to God, he did all he could to hide it. He thought he had\\nsucceeded but the issue eventually came up and cut short his life. The same\\nwill happen to every man who covers his sin. Don\\'t be eaten up by the fact\\nthat nothing happened when you sinned; the consequence of every sin goes ahead\\nto wait for you in the future. Do not be ignorant of the fact that God visits\\nthe sin of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation\\n(Deut 5:9).

This is not the time to panic but the time to be confident in God\\'s protection. Remember, *“For in him we live, and move, and have our being...\"* Acts17:28.Also God hints us about such a time as this in Luke 21:25; *“... and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity...\"* However,as a Christian, you must know how to respond correctly in this situation.1. *Feed your faith-* stop looking for fearful news and loading yourself up with them! The more of such news you receive the more your fears. This is the time to study your Bible and listen to faith filled messages from anointed preachers. Be loaded with the word!!! Romans 10:17.2. *Stir up your faith by praying in the Holy ghost.* Do plenty of praying with tongues at this period. Jude 20. It will refresh you, embolden you and strengthen your faith!3. *Do not talk fear!* Don\\'t say things like \\'I hope this virus will not destroy the whole world before December\\'. Talking fear will condition your spirit wrongly and open the door for the spirit of fear to take a hold of you. Don\\'t forget,fear kills faster than death itself. 2Timothy 1:7.4. *Don\\'t spread the news,leave that to the media.* Do not be an instrument in the hands of Satan to advertise his work. His intention is to dominate the world with fear. As a Christian, you\\'re to spread the message of hope, faith and love. Let the world know that our God is bigger than coronavirus! Ephesians 6:15.5. *Don\\'t discuss,pray!* This not the time to discuss and make fun out of the present panic in the world, it\\'s the time to pray and stop that devil in his tracks. Tell him to leave our lands in the name of Jesus!! 1Peter5:8-9.6. *Remember the bereaved in your prayers.* Pray that the Lord will comfort them by His Spirit and strengthen them to be able to bear their loss.Hebrew 13:3.SAY: *I DECLARE THAT IN ALL THESE THINGS MY FAMILY AND I ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS, IN JESUS NAME!*PLEASE SHARE WITH EVERYBODY, LET\\'S GET RID OF FEAR. -BY APOSTLE VICTOR PETERS.\\n\\n',\n",

If you start it, even\\npeople who donate money to the church will be asking for things and places to\\nbe named after them. You can\\'t be an RCCG member (not just come and go member)\\nwithout passing through the believers class.

              "  'content': '\"Benny Hinn Must Clarify Tithing Teachings Or Offer Refund To Those He Misled\"\\n- Bishop George BloomerBy Leah MarieAnn Klett, Christian Post Reporter|\\nMonday, September 09, 2019Bishop George Bloomer responded to televangelist\\nBenny Hinn\\'s recent rejection of the prosperity gospel and said that the famed\\ntelevangelist needs to clarify what the Bible says about tithes and offerings\\nor offer a refund to the millions he misled.On Sunday, the pastor and founder\\nof Bethel Family Worship Centre shared his thoughts on Hinn, who last week\\nseemingly renounced the prosperity gospel, which teaches that God rewards\\nactive faith with health and wealth. Hinn has taught the controversial\\ndoctrine since the 1980s and made millions.Bloomer said that in his own\\nministry, he has \"from time to time\" read Scripture and come to a new\\nrevelation or understanding of an ancient text.\"Before running out and sharing\\nit with everyone, I go over it and then I make my apologies,\" he said. \"So I\\'m\\nnot bothered by new revelations, I\\'m not bothered by maturing and coming to a\\nbrand new understanding. I\\'m not bothered by a person having a personal\\nconviction about something that they\\'re doing and want to correct it. I\\'m not\\nbothered by that.\"However, the bishop said if he discovers that what he\\'s\\ntaught over the last 20 years on any given topic is \"wrong,\" then he owes a\\nrefund to every person he misled. \"I owe them a refund ... if I am a shyster,\\nif I am selling a product and the product that I am selling is flawed,\" he\\nemphasized.Bloomer explained that the idea of tithing is biblical: \"Whenever I\\nneed something from God, I never go to the Lord empty-handed,\" he said. \"The\\nBible declares that a portion of our dough shall be placed into the hand of\\nthe priest so that the glory of the Lord would not depart from this\\nhouse.\"\"The foundations of what we believe is based in, predicated upon\\ngiving,\" he continued. \"For God so loved the world that He gave his only\\nbegotten Son and required the same thing from Abraham to offer his son Isaac,\\nhis only son, up.\"The bishop clarified he\\'s not saying the prosperity gospel\\nis \"all right\" or \"all wrong,\" adding: \"What I\\'m saying is that there are bad\\npeople everywhere.\"\"[They] had police officers, they had sheriffs, bad judges,\\nbad preachers, bad Christians everywhere,\" he said. \"But it doesn\\'t mean that\\neverything is off because of that.\"\"Listen to me, there are crooks and\\ncharlatans out there everywhere. But I tell you this, the Scriptures tell us\\nthat blessed is the cheerful giver.\"There a number of tithes and offerings\\noutlined in the Bible, the pastor said, from freewill and sacrificial\\nofferings to sin and repentance offerings. \"Whatever offering you fit into,\\nthe God that we serve has established His kingdom on this principle. As long\\nas the earth remains, there will be seedtime and harvest,\" he declared.\\nBloomer ended his sermon with a message to Benny Hinn: \"I say to you, Pastor\\nBenny, on behalf of the clergy around the world, that your convictions are\\ncorrect, but they\\'re personal. And I just asked you to do one thing: Share\\nwith the body of Christ scripturally like I just did, and then we\\'ll be fine.\\nIf not, you owe the body of Christ a refund on all of the thousands and tens\\nof thousands of dollars that you have received from them when you told them\\nthat this is the Word of God.\"\"I\\'m waiting on your response,\" he concluded. On\\nSeptember 2, Hinn told his studio audience and those watching online: \"I am\\ncorrecting my own theology and you need to all know it. Because when I read\\nthe Bible now, I don\\'t see the Bible in the same eyes I saw 20 years ago.\"\"I\\nthink it\\'s an offense to the Lord, it\\'s an offense to say give $1,000. I think\\nit\\'s an offense to the Holy Spirit to place a price on the Gospel. I\\'m done\\nwith it. I will never again ask you to give $1,000 or whatever amount because\\nI think the Holy Ghost is just fed up with it.\"This is not the first time Hinn\\nhas seemingly backtracked on his teachings. In February 2018, he said in a\\nFacebook Live video that, while he believed the Bible does teach prosperity,\\n\"I think some have gone to the extreme with it, sadly.\"\"It\\'s not God\\'s word\\nthat is taught, and I think I\\'m as guilty as others,\" he said in the video.\\n\"Sometimes you go a little farther than you really need to go, and then God\\nbrings you back to normality and reality.\"The televangelist claimed he had\\ncome to believe that prosperity means not \"palatial homes and cars,\" but\\nrather \"no lack.\"\"It\\'s time to live biblically,\" he said, adding, \"We all want\\nto finish right.\"Costi Hinn, Benny Hinn\\'s nephew who has publicly criticized\\nthe prosperity gospel, said that while he\\'s \"encouraged\" by his uncle\\'s\\ndeclaration, he\\'s waiting to see \"undeniable, lasting fruit that exemplifies\\ngenuine repentance.\"\"I think you got to sit down and you got to invite some\\nguys in the room who are from outside your camp,\" he told The Gospel Coalition\\nin a recent interview. \"I think you need to start submitting, and you\\nliterally take all the money and all the resources and go OK, what is the one\\nthing, and this would take strategy, and brainstorming, and good wisdom, and\\nprayer. What\\'s the one thing we can do with what we have left? We\\'re not going\\nto salvage it all, but we\\'re not focused on the past anymore. This is\\nrepentance.\"\"The cleanup process would be years and years,\" he acknowledged.\\n\"But isn\\'t that the beauty of revival, and of restoration, and of repentance\\nis?\"Truth, Costi Hinn said, \"comes with a cost.\"\"That is the picture of\\nrestitution. I\\'m forsaking everything and I\\'m coming after Jesus no matter\\nwhat,\" he added.Source\\n\\n',\n",
              "  'response': \"Facts about tithes your pastor will never tell you–the reason of tithes is for\\nfood not to run out in the church–the tithe was shared amongst the priest,\\nlevites and the poor in a certain percentage–tithing in the Bible was never\\nmonetary, it was only foodstuffs that was brought in as tithes–tithing was for\\nonly farmers and herders. If you do other job apart from farming eg daily pay,\\nweavers, goldsmith etc you are exempted from paying tithes–tithing was not\\nmonthly, it was yearly–tithing is in the book of Moses. The laws in the books\\nof Moses are no longer in use. Funny how pastors singled only tithing out. So,\\nif you are not a farmer or a herder, paying tithes is not Biblical. Even for\\nthe farmers it is not compulsory because tithing is a mosaic law. Don't listen\\nto your pastors when they blackmail you with hell or gates of heaven closing\\nagainst you. If you want to give money to God, do it as a voluntary donation\\nand not because you were forced to. And you should know that it is not only in\\nchurch that you can give God money. If you give it to charity, it's still God\\nyou have given. As a matter of fact, the Bible mandates us to do charities. It\\nis the lack of charity that will take you to hell and not non payments of\\ntithes. Remember the parable of the goats and the sheep. There are so many\\nverses that encourages us to do charity both in the old testament and the new\\ntestament. But your pastor might not tell you this cos it won't benefit him.\\nHe who has ears, let him hear.\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': 'I created this thread in response to a thread on front page about witnessing a\\nmiracle.This is my personal experience.My sister is a nurse and often have\\nsome patients whom she treats at home. Most times she uses my room for\\npatients that will take drip.One the faithful day, a woman was taking drip in\\nmy room, she told me she was pressed and wanted to ease her self. I went to\\nfetch my sister and notified her the woman needed her attention. She now\\nbegged to stay in the shop for her so she can go and attend to the woman.After\\nsome minutes, my sister ran into the shop like somebody being chased by a\\nlion. I looked up, her eyes were filled with tears. I was startled, I asked\\nher what\\'s the matter, she broke the news to me.THE WOMAN WAS DEAD.I was\\nshocked on hearing this , and ran to the room, and saw the woman lying\\nlifeless on my bed.I looked at my sister, she was in serious sober, I told her\\nto calm down, that medicine has failed, let\\'s try God.Immediately I reached\\nfor my Bible, and interestingly it was still open as I used it for my morning\\ndevotion.Lo and behold my eyes hit the Bible verse I studied that\\nmorning.Psalm 6:5\" In death there\\'s no remembrance of thee, in grave who will\\ngive you praise\".I held unto that verse strongly and started praying with it.I\\ntold God that if this woman dies, she would not give Him praise in grave. Then\\nI reached for the annointing oil, tried opening her mouth,and met stiff\\nresistance from her teeth, we have to get a spoon to force her teeth open, we\\neven injured her in the process, then I poured the annointing oil into her\\nmouth .While we continued praying, to my greatest shock in life, the woman\\nstood up and started singing praises. When I first heard her voice as my eyes\\nwere closed while praying, sincerely I was shocked my mouth was wide agap. I\\ncouldn\\'t move again, I practically frooze like I saw a ghost. The woman\\ncontinued singing, while I was still stuck in my shock.Later my sister called\\nthe husband who works with civil defence to notify him of what happened and to\\ncome immediately, it took the man about three hours to come to our house,\\nwhile the distance from his office to our house is just about 10 minutes\\ndrive.When he came, entered my room, saw his wife sitting down, he did not\\neven utter a word to the wife. He went to a bar opposite my house, bought beer\\nand was drinking. Then we knew something wasn\\'t right. Some boys in the hood\\non understanding what was happening, wanted to go and beat up the husband, but\\nwe pleaded to them we don\\'t want any form of drama, that we\\'ve already had\\nenough.We approached the wife, she told us the husband wanted her dead, and\\ntold us to call her son who was in polytechnic in another town.We have to call\\nthe boy to start coming home immediately.We also called other family members\\nof the woman, as the woman said she will not leave our house. Later the woman\\nasked us which church we attend. We told her it\\'s not about church but about\\nrelationship with God. She later found out our church and went there and gave\\nher testimony, till date she still worhips there.Please men and brethren,\\nthere is a miracle working God, and He is still in the business of doing\\nmiracle.MODIFIED.Please anybody that wants to verify this should come up. I\\nwill give details of where it happened . The person can go to the hood and ask\\npeople there.Presently I have relocated to another state, so obviously the\\nperson can do it without my knowledge.\\n\\n',\n",

Something is about to happen: a dark cloud that will come in\\nform of disease, will pass through the air (it is an air born disease) but it\\nis not natural.

I see the LORD JESUS CHRIST later on stepping in but the church was\\nalmost helpless, so expect churches rising up against themselves, and their\\nleaders. Blackmails with great and dirty exposures shall be made and new\\ndoctrines shall emerge.3) Expect the government coming after churches. I saw\\nchurches been shut down by government under this and that laws, finding them\\nguilty of one thing or the other and churches been shut and pulled down.4) I\\nam seeing messy accusations on about three ministers of God, very dirty\\naccusations involving women, money and things like that, almost closing down\\ntheir churches and members almost distancing themselves from their leaders.5)\\nMost churches and christian leaders this year (2020) and 2021 have to stand to\\ndefend their heads because God is about to purge His church and the devil\\nwants to make a very dare move.6) This year (2020) and 2021 is going to be\\nvery critical and what we are going to see this year is going to be far less\\ncomparing to what will take place 2021, because 2021 is going to be a very\\ncritical year, but I see God suddenly blessing people in the least and most\\nunexpected way, very quietly but before they could know things are turned\\naround and God tells them, \"keep quiet!\" I see God raising hopes of people\\nthat ordinarily people have abandoned. I see God quietly visiting them and\\nblessing those, people have abandoned. I don\\'t know your circumstances and\\nsituations, but the most unexpected turnaround is about to take place.7) Those\\npeople who felt they have all, they know this and that, will suddenly get\\ntheir shoulders broken.12) I see burial of most of the proud leaders, I saw\\nthem being removed in coffins; some were shamefully disgraced out. I see\\nleaders having battles with their followers; I see churches dividing and only\\nthe leader one side and the entire church one side. Churches will face\\nchallenges this year because God is about to purge the church and in the\\nprocess of purges, it will be like every where has become quiet, the people\\nthat were helping the church will suddenly give up and begin to insult and\\ncondemn the church and the church will burst into tears; there will be\\ndesperate cry from the church, but mid part of the year June - July I see\\ndivine remembrance begin to happen.• So, let the church of God humble\\nthemselves, unite, forgive each other, be together and stand together, so that\\nthis calamity can bypass them because, God said \"when I see the blood I will\\npass over you\" (when I see the mark of my covenant still standing in the\\nchurch this iniquity will not come upon you) because, I see God stepping out\\nof some churches and the devil immediately took over those churches. 18)\\nStrange kind of accidents will happen this year.

If only correct words could save, then\\nthe devil and demons should be saved, because they have CORRECT Bible\\nknowledge too, far more than many of us, in fact.Remember the thief on the\\ncross might not have had any Bible knowledge, but because of his repentant\\nheart and humility, Jesus told him he would meet Him in Paradise. Hence,\\nalthough Correct Bible knowledge is very important, I wouldn\\'t be satisfied\\nwith just that in my personal life, NOR would I follow a Man/Church leader\\nwhose life contradicts the Life of the Cross of Christ, one way or the other,\\nwith or without Bible knowledge and other great gifts.Paul to Titus:Titus.2.7\\n- And you yourself MUST BE AN EXAMPLE to them by DOING GOOD DEEDS of every\\nkind. Let \"everything\" you DO reflect the integrity and SERIOUSNESS of your\\nteaching.Also, in that Matt. 23, Jesus wasn\\'t just exposing these types of\\nReligious Men but further down He said:Matt.23.13 ... Hypocrites! For you\\nwon\\'t let \"others\" ENTER the Kingdom of Heaven, and YOU WON\\'T GO in\\nyourselves.Matt.23.15 - Yes, how terrible it will be for you... ...For you\\nCROSS land and sea to make one CONVERT, and then you turn him into TWICE the\\nSON OF HELL as you yourselves ARE.That\\'s why it\\'s dangerous to keep following\\nsuch type, because they have Correct Words/Doctrines and others, but they deny\\nJesus by their LOVE of the World: the Love of Money and Honour of Men\\n(Popularity).Going the way of Balaam, Judas and Demas, they are ENEMIES of the\\nCross of Christ. So, they don\\'t make Jesus disciples (who obey His Words), but\\nlike-minded \"Club Members\" whom they use to make Money, live like Celebrities\\nand CEOs by using their poor member\\'s Money to live luxuriously, build profit-\\ndriven resources for themselves and the Rich. (Phil. 3:18-19)These are the\\ntype now seeking Un-christlike Peace and Unity among other False Religious\\nleaders (Antichrists), and World Rulers. These are indeed the End times!Alas,\\nMANY sincere people or believers don\\'t see through all these, but are just\\nseated with their mouths WIDE opened, gulping down ALL the Religious junks\\nthey dish out. This again is a MAJOR sign of the last days (see Matt.\\n24:24)Let\\'s be HONEST, do we really FEAR Religious Men/People OR\\nGod?Matt.10.28 - \"Don\\'t be afraid of those who want to KILL YOU. They can ONLY\\nkill your body; they CANNOT touch your soul. FEAR ONLY God, who can DESTROY\\nBOTH soul and body in HELL.A true Servant or Disciple of Christ must be able\\nto say like Paul:1Cor.11.1 - And you should FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE, just as I\\nFOLLOW Christ\\'s.Phil.3.17 - Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives\\nAFTER MINE, \"and LEARN from those who follow OUR EXAMPLE\".The kingdom of God\\nis not just speaking Correct Words but in Obedience: 1Cor.4.20 - For the\\nkingdom of God is NOT in WORD but in POWER (to be Holy or Christlike).Are we\\nreally following Men after the life of Christ, or the likes of Balaam, Judas,\\nand Demas (who mind Earthly honours and things)? (See Phil. 3:18)It says we\\ncan\\'t be ABOVE them but end up being like them as their followers (whether\\ngood or bad). (Matt 10:25)We\\'ve got to Repent of Self or Men-centered Religion\\nof worshipping Religious MEN, which is based on just Religious Words,\\nActivities, Worldly Prosperity/Popularity, fake promises, flimsy testimonies,\\nStories without the REALITY of the Cross of Christ in one\\'s lifestyle: the\\nPOWER of the gospel.FINALLY:2Tim.3.1 - But MARK this: There will be TERRIBLE\\nTIMES in the last days.2Tim.3.2 - People will be LOVERS of themselves, LOVERS\\nof money, boastful, proud...2Tim.3.5 - having A FORM of godliness but DENYING\\nITS POWER. And from \"such people\" TURN AWAY!It\\'s time to awake from our DEEP\\nSLEEP!Let THOSE that have EARS to hear, let them HEAR.May Jesus bless you.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Seeds Of DestinyThe Lifting Power Of Uprightness 19 July 2020 CLICK HERE TO\\nREAD MORE Seeds of destiny & other daily devotional here What God celebrates,\\nwe must also celebrate. The principle of association means the thing that is\\ncelebrated the most by God in heaven must be celebrated the most by men on\\nearth. SCRIPTURE: Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in\\nthy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and\\nspeaketh the truth in his heart. Psalm 15:1-2.THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: To be\\nupright is to be right up. It has been established that upright character is a\\nlifter of life. Holiness is a lifter of destiny. The most celebrated attribute\\nof God is His Holiness. That is, the greatest attribute of God is His\\ncharacter of Holiness. Human beings may boast about money and other material\\nresources but the thing that Jehovah celebrates most is His character of\\nHoliness. Now, you can see supportive evidence of the Holiness of God from\\nIsaiah 6:1-3: In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting\\nupon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it\\nstood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face,\\nand with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried\\nunto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole\\nearth is full of his glory.Please note that the angels did not cry, “Power!\\nPower! Power! is the Lord of hosts” or “Wisdom! Wisdom! Wisdom! is the Lord of\\nhosts” but “Holy! Holy! Holy! is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of\\nHis glory”. Of all the things that God has that the angels could cry about,\\nthe Holiness of His Character was the most relevant. This is also corroborated\\nin Revelation 4:8. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him;\\nand they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying,\\nHoly, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.This\\nmeans, what God celebrates, we must also celebrate. The principle of\\nassociation means the thing that is celebrated the most by God in heaven must\\nbe celebrated the most by men on earth. Now, the question is, how does\\nuprightness lift a person? 1. Uprightness catapults men into the sphere with\\nGod. Uprightness catapults people into the operational spheres of God. And God\\nis not on the ground; God is the high and lifted One. So, if uprightness\\ncatapults you to a realm where God is, it means that uprightness catapults you\\nto heavenly places (Psalm 24:3-4, Isaiah 33:15-16). It is not possible to be\\ngrounded with uprightness. To be upright is to be right up. Beloved, make up\\nyour mind to be upright in all your ways in order to end right up.Remember\\nthis: To be upright is to be right up.

              "  'content': 'The Ecclesia is the body of Christ, but we must understand that the body of\\nChrist does not involve the carnal man. Each one of us still have a measure of\\nthe carnal man in us, if we don\\'t then we will be incapable of committing sin.\\nBut if you still commit sin, no matter how little, then you still have a\\nmeasure of the carnal man in you.\"For to be carnally minded is death, but to\\nbe spiritually minded is life and peace.\" (Rom 8:6).\"and be renewed in the\\nspirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created\\naccording to God, in true righteousness and holiness.\" (Eph 4:23-24).These\\nscriptures were written to believers not unbelievers. Yes, we have been made\\nanew, but we have to put on that new man. Putting on the new man involves\\nkilling the old man. Yes, we are called to kill the old man so that the new\\nman can occupy. The land where the old man is occupying is meant for the new\\nman, it has been promised to the new man. The new man is the one born of God,\\nthe new man is the one that constitute the body of Christ. The carnal man is\\nnever part of the body of Christ. So the body of Christ have been promised\\nthat land (heart) occupied by the carnal man. This gives us a picture of the\\nchildren of Israel and how they were promised Canaan land but it was occupied\\nby pagans and sinful people. “When the Lord your God brings you into the land\\nyou are about to enter and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of\\nyou: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and\\nJebusites. These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you. When\\nthe Lord your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you\\nmust completely destroy them. Make no treaties with them and show them no\\nmercy. You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons\\nmarry their sons and daughters, for they will lead your children away from me\\nto worship other gods. Then the anger of the Lord will burn against you, and\\nhe will quickly destroy you. This is what you must do. You must break down\\ntheir pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah\\npoles and burn their idols. For you are a holy people, who belong to the Lord\\nyour God. Of all the people on earth, the Lord your God has chosen you to be\\nhis own special treasure.\" (Deu 7:1-6).The same way God asked them to\\nexterminate the the former occupant of Canaan land, He has given us the task\\nof exterminating the carnal man in us. The carnal man is the one that is prone\\nto sin and setting idols. The carnal man is so quick to idolizing anything. He\\nwill idolize the man of God, the place of worship, and even the Bible. We\\ncannot allow this man in our midst, for he is prone to everything carnal;\\nhatred, envy, jealousy, anger, strife, and so on. The carnal man makes\\necclesia life unbearable. It\\'s not easy trying to bond with someone that is\\neasily irritated, can\\'t tolerate anything, easily gets angry and provoke,\\ncunning, lies all the time, deceptive and so on.Many genuine fellowship have\\nbeen recked by the presence of the carnal man. Some group feels they can try\\nto manage the carnal man and hope that he will die someday. But here is what\\nGod has to say about that, \"you must completely destroy them. Make no treaties\\nwith them and show them no mercy.\" (Deu 7:2). God is saying make no\\naccommodation for the carnal man. Our job is not to manage him, hoping that he\\nwill die one day. We are to show no mercy. This is a deliberate attack, we are\\nnot meant to be passive towards the carnal man, we are to unleash a fierce\\nattack against him because this is war. Now the problem is how can we unleash\\na fierce attack against the carnal man and yet win the believer? This is where\\nwisdom and technicality is needed. Many Christians tend to protect their\\ncarnal man. They try to cover up their carnal man, dress him up, make him look\\nnice and innocent. We heavily disguised our carnal man so that nobody will\\nnotice him or even point him out. One can still manage to hide the carnal man\\nin a church system, but in ecclesia you can\\'t hide the him for long, he will\\nsurely surface. And when he is pointed out we have the tendency to take up a\\ndefensive position. We don\\'t like it when our carnal man is confronted, some\\nof us would even turn very vicious. Some brethren may leave the fellowship\\njust because their carnal man was pointed out. So how can we attack and\\nexterminate the carnal man while winning the believer? There is a way you can\\nfiercely attack something without confrontation. If you have rats or mice in\\nyour home, and each time you confront them they run somewhere to hide, making\\nit difficult to kill them. You can still exterminate them by fumigating the\\nhouse. When you use fumigation the vermin will suffocate and die wherever they\\nare. There is a kind of atmosphere that can be created in the ecclesia that\\nwould suffocate the carnal man and cause him to die slow but steadily. You\\nwill just find the carnal man slowly dying even without outright\\nconfrontation. This atmosphere is created by the structural design of an\\necclesia — a structure that only a specialist can set up. And God is training\\nsuch specialists in our days.\\n\\n',\n",

God want his people to have an attitude of I will\\nnot worry for the sake of God. As a Christian do not worry because you have a\\nGod who is caring, He is the good Shepherd that take good cares of his\\nflocks.Instead of worrying get down on your kneel, pray to God, tell God that\\nproblem that is making you to worry, ask God to help you and to rescue you\\nfrom your suffering and believe without doubt and fear in your mind that God\\nwill give you victory over your trouble. The God who answer prayers will hear\\nyour prayer and will send help and deliverance into your Life.Worrying is not\\ngood for your Christian life, and it can hinder your blessings from God. When\\nyou are worrying you can’t concentrate on what you do. Worrying makes you make\\nmistakes which you could have avoided if you were not worrying. Worry can\\nweaken you from praying to God if you allow it. But I am telling you today\\nthat you have a Mighty God who can rescue you from that worries, all you have\\nto do is to seek the help of God through prayer and fasting. Never give up, do\\nnot be discourage, God is aware of your suffering and he is sending help your\\nway. It will not be long, your trouble shall be a thing of the past. Just\\nbelieve in Jesus Christ as your Messiah and in God as the one who exist and\\nreward those who diligently seek him. Turn away from your evil and begin to do\\nthe right thing always. You can also overcome your worries by asking your\\nfellow Christians, Church members to assist you in prayer.MATTHEW 18 : 19“And\\nI tell you more: whenever two of you on earth agree about anything you pray\\nfor, it will be done for you by Father in heaven.You can ask your fellow\\nbrothers and sisters in Christ to assist and pray with you concerning the\\ntrouble you are facing. There is power in prayer. Pray every day with the\\nfollowing Scripture chapters; psalms 9, psalms 70, psalms 91, psalms 121, and\\npsalms 138. Do not be discourage and afraid and worry any more because of the\\nsuffering you are passing through just have faith in God, pray and believe\\nthat by the help of God everything will be alright again.Pray with this prayer\\nbelow ;PRAYERMy Father in heaven, I thank and praise you for your love which\\ncares for me. Have mercy on me God, forgive all my sins and make me holy\\nagain. Help me Lord and deliver me from all my worries. I come to you for\\nhelp, please Lord give me solution to my worries and let your Love protect me.\\nMay the blood of Jesus Christ cover me and rescue me from my troubles.

              "  'content': 'There is a popular adage that says “Show me your friend and I will tell you\\nwho you are.” This saying is very true. No matter how spiritual you are, 1st\\nCorinthians 15:33 says that “Evil communications corrupt good manners.” There\\nare certain friends who would pull you back and there are others who would\\nhelp you grow spiritually and in other areas of life. Choose your friends\\nwisely. Before I became born again, I had friends with whom I regularly drank\\nalcoholic wines. Then, I met Christ and my lifestyle changed. When my friends\\nvisited, I served them non-alcoholic drinks, and before long, they realised\\nthat things were different, and withdrew from me. It was painful to lose my\\nfriends then, but I let them go because I didn’t want them to drag me back to\\nthe world. Today, God has replaced those friends with a lot of brothers and\\nsisters all over the world. I have made new friends who have helped me in my\\nwalk with God. It is this kind of friends that you should have too – friends\\nwho will draw you closer to God, challenge you to pursue your dreams, pray\\nwith you when you are down and whose positive impact on your life will be\\nevident to all. I must warn you that such friends are not many, but even if it\\nis only one of such you can find, he/she is better than a hundred others who\\nwould pull you down. Jesus is the best friend that any man can have. He said\\nin John 15:15 that: “….I have called you friends; for all things that I have\\nheard of my Father I have made known unto you.” Jesus’ friendship should be\\nyour standard. If you cannot see through a person’s lifestyle that they have a\\nrelationship with Jesus, then they should not be your friend. While Matthew\\n22:39 says that we should love our neighbours as ourselves, we are only to\\nhave a few true friends. Jesus loved everyone when He was on earth, but He\\nkept His inner circle small. Don’t hate those you cannot be friends with. You\\nmust love them; just don’t share intimate things with them. Set clear\\nboundaries. Remember, Iron sharpens iron (Proverbs 27:17).

With respect to the\\nchallenges you are facing God is testing you, the devil is tempting you and\\nyou are passing through trials of\\nlife!!!************************************Scriptural Reference\"Count it all\\njoy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the\\ntesting of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its\\nfull effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. (James\\n1:2-4 ESV) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For everything that has to do with your\\nlife, God who is your creator and devil your arc enemy is very interested.\\nEverything you are passing through; to God it is a test, but to Satan is a\\ntemptation and to you in the situation it is a trial. Test of life is\\nnecessary because God will never use a man He has not proved and He will never\\nplace anything serious into the hands of a man who cannot stand the test of\\ntime. The likes of Joseph, Abraham, Daniel and David were tried before they\\nbecame something for God. The devil will always try all he can do to ensure\\nthat you fall and your destiny fails under God. Hence, you must submit\\nyourself to God and His principles. If a man is resolute in his decision to\\nobey God, he cannot fail no matter how great the temptations before him. A man\\nonly falls each time he is caught in the trap of selfish desire. Always ask\\nGod to help, comfort and strengthen you in every situation of\\nlife.___________________________________Question For Meditation:+ What is God\\nsaying about you as far as various test, trials and temptation is concerned?\\nPrayer Point:Lord! I will not fail in every trial of life in Jesus name.\\nAmen!!! Main Emphasis:Test, Trials and Temptation are inevitable in every\\nfacet of life!!! Have a Graceful Worship Experience!!!\\n\\n',\n",

Actually, if you expect nothing from anybody,\\nyou're never disappointed. Let's use marriage as a case study. Peradventure a\\nwoman's has high expectations from her suitor. She sets standards which he\\nmust meet up to if eventually he is to marry her. He should be tall,\\ndark/fair, slim, wealthy, intelligent, romantic, and caring. Such a woman has\\na high chance to be disappointed as her expectations are too high. She might\\nend up unhappy and heartbroken on the long run. High expectation is the source\\nof disappointment. Expectations are like fine pottery, the harder you hold\\nthem, the more likely they are to crack. You can't expect everyone to have the\\nsame dedication, idea or mentality as you. When you stop expecting people to\\nbe perfect, you can like them for who they are. Stop expecting too much from\\nyour spouse, uncle, child, parents or whosoever you fancy.

Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.However,in the present day\\nworld,terrorists,extremists who call themselves 'jihadist' carry out extreme\\nactivities hiding under the umbrella of Islam.I call it extreme activity\\nbecause it is beyond normal.This article is meant to give Islam's view on the\\nactivities of these criminals. Terrorism can be categorised under\\nextremism.Terrorism is the use of violence means to implement a\\npolitical,religious, or ethnical agenda.An Islamic scholar defined extremism\\nas an acting of doing things beyond normal and went further ahead to classify\\nterrorism as a type of extremism. What is 'jihad'?Jihad in Arabic literally\\nmeans struggle or strive.This term was used in the Qur'an in a different\\ncontext as it was clearly stated in the Holy Qur'an chapter 61:v11 as I quote\\nit's translation:'Believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in His cause\\nwith your wealth and your soul,these are the best for you if you all\\nknow'.Striving with wealth as stated above means spending wealth in the cause\\nof looking after one's family,neighbours,empowering muslims and even non-\\nmuslims etc with an evidence backing these from Qur'an9:v60 as I quote 'verily\\ncharity is the poor,the needy,the collectors,the ones we seek to please'.The\\none we seek to please as stated means those who are not muslims. Soul as\\nstated in the first verse I quoted means using our physical strength e.g to\\ncall people to Islam without disturbing them. A verse from the Qur'an backs\\ncalling people to Islam without disturbing or forcing them or use violence as\\nI quote 'there shall be no compulsion in(acceptance of) the\\nreligion(Islam),the right course has become clear from the wrong'(Qur'an\\n2:v256).

Will you allow the devil to defeats you?Don't\\nexpect the devil to come with gun,arrows or sword before you understand that\\nhe's against you,through cunningness and craftiness, he had succeeded over\\nthousands of giants in faith and also looking for any means to hold you down,\\nwill you give him a chance?Don't give room to these dangerous arrows in your\\nlife,beware!The devil will never dare it with any man or woman that is a\\ncarrier of anointing and grace, in Matt. 4:1-12, if jesus could not withheld\\nhis own attack from the devil after fasted for forty days and forty night, you\\ncannot escape attack from the devil, but your ability to resist the devil\\nmakes you a winner.Nevertheless the church and christians of nowadays are\\nfilled up with attacked and dead, empty and non anointed christians. why?,\\nthis is because the devil has seen the glorious future of the church and how\\nthey are likely to dethrone his government.you must be ready to rise against\\nhis fiery darts and attack in order to conquer him. You must be ready to take\\nback your right by force. you must be ready to launched back his arrow against\\nyour life.The anointing is what keeps you intact with God's presence, it is\\nwhat keeps the power flow. With the anointing you can command fire, with the\\nanointing, sickness, pain cannot stand, it is the strength of the believers,\\nthis the power line for signs and wonders.Act 10:38, How God anointed Jesus\\nwith holy host and with power...You must understand where you have missed it\\nand retrace your way back to God for fresh fire and anointing.The 10 major\\narrows that drain anointing in the lives of christian\\nare;[color=#990000][/color]1.

              "  'content': 'Believer, can you imagine an air-conditioner that is not connected to\\nelectricity boasting to its maker that it can work by itself and all to prove\\nthat it loves its maker? No matter how much it tries, it cannot work unless\\nits maker plugs it into electricity, services it and makes sure that it is in\\ngood working condition always. This is a picture of our salvation in Christ.\\nBut many of us do not know how fallen humanity is. Paul said it well in Romans\\n7:18- “For I know that nothing good lives within the flesh of my fallen\\nhumanity. The longings to do what is right are within me, but will-power is\\nnot enough to accomplish it.”Remember Peter seemed to be making good on his\\npromise to not deny Jesus at first — he slashed off someone\\'s ear when the\\nsoldiers came to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane, ready to defend Christ. Then his\\ncircumstances changed and he sang a different tune…three times. Jesus knew\\nPeter\\'s default mode from the start, the same as all mankind- to commit sin\\neven though the longing to do what is right is there. But Peter had no idea\\nthat the reason why he could slash off someone\\'s ear for Jesus (a work of the\\nflesh which Christ does not even want!) was because he had not been tempted\\nbeyond what he could bear, otherwise he would have scampered off earlier than\\nbefore his denial! Same thing with all mankind. With all of the knowledge of\\nthe Ten Commandments, man’s default mode is to do wickedness (Romans 3:9–18.)\\nOf ourselves, there is no good in anyone of us. Peter knew and heard the Ten\\nCommandments probably more than anyone reading this today, \"but will-power is\\nnot enough to accomplish it.\" What is the point of rattling out sins and the\\nLaw every Sunday without pointing the hearer to the One who died to save us\\nfrom our sins (Titus 2:14) and to redeem us from slavery to the law (Galatians\\n5:1)? We often think that \"other people\" who are sinning want to wallow in\\ntheir sins and don\\'t want to stop so we have to tell \"them\" to stop\\nfornicating, coveting, etc- as if we are the only ones who hate sin! No\\nfriend. I believe that Romans 7:18 above is true for many sinners: people\\nalready know the law and want to be doers, \"...but will-power is not enough to\\naccomplish it.\" The more such try to keep the law in order to be saved and\\nescape God\\'s wrath as they are told to do in church, the more sin has\\ndominion- \"For sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under law\\nbut under Grace.\" Romans 6:14. But many have this verse backwards.People need\\nto hear about the Way out of sins. The Way has got nothing to do with our\\n“strong moral resolve, will-power or determination” which will all fail\\nwhenever one gets tempted beyond what he can bear. The Way is Grace. Grace is\\na Person. His name is Jesus Christ. Titus 2:11 says of Him: \"11 God’s\\nmarvelous grace has manifested in person, bringing salvation for everyone.\"\\nSee verse 14 of the same Titus 2: \"He gave His life to free us from every kind\\nof sin, to cleanse us, and to make us His very own people, totally committed\\nto doing good deeds.\"Christ came to free us from every kind of sin and to\\ntransform us to right living, just as He transformed Simon (meaning \"Reed\"-\\neasily swayed by the elements) into Peter (meaning \"Rock\"- bold and unshakable\\nin any kind of weather.) Those who can transform themselves by their will-\\npower that can never be enough do not need Grace, and only by Grace through\\nfaith are we saved. The law is not of faith.Telling people to \"stop sinning\"\\nis not enough. Telling people to \"pay tithe\" or \"stop fornicating\" or \"honour\\nyour parents\" so that God can bless you is quite pointless if it is not\\naccompanied with plugging them into the \"Electric Charge\" that is Christ who\\ngives life and saves from sins. People already know that sin is terrible and\\nmany desire to do right but the will-power is just not enough in any of\\nus.Christ says In John 15:5- “I am the Vine, you are the branches. He who\\nabides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do\\nnothing.\"See the TPT: “I am the sprouting Vine and you’re My branches. As you\\nlive in union with Me as your Source, fruitfulness will stream from within\\nyou—but when you live separated from Me you are powerless.\"Without Christ, we\\nare as powerless as an AC without electricity and maintenance; as powerless\\nand useless as a branch that has no source. It just can\\'t work. But some might\\nthink: \"I am not that bad. A person should at least try to be good and I am\\ndoing good things by my effort.\" Such are yet to understand that the reason\\nwhy they are not wallowing in sins and seem to be able to keep the law is\\nbecause they have not been tempted beyond what they can bear. See 1\\nCorinthians 10:12-13:\"12 So beware if you think it could never happen to you,\\nlest your pride becomes your downfall. 13 We all experience times of testing,\\nwhich is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He\\nwill screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial\\nyou face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust Him\\nmore, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that\\nwill bring you out of it victoriously.\"If God was not screening and filtering\\nour trials, we would all see the extent of the sinfulness of human nature in\\nourselves. Paul addressed this in Romans 1 where a group who “suppress the\\ntruth” of righteousness by faith (verses 16-19) DEVOLVED into sin after “God\\nlifted off His restraining hand…” —“24 This is why God lifted off His\\nrestraining hand and let them have full expression of their sinful and\\nshameful desires…”Such who say they are not that bad, can keep the law or have\\nsome good in them also contradict God\\'s word: “For I know that nothing good\\nlives within the flesh of my fallen humanity. The longings to do what is right\\nare within me, but will-power is not enough to accomplish it.” Romans\\n7:18.Once a person is \"plugged in\" and is being \"serviced and maintained\" by\\nChrist the same way you plug an AC to electricity and maintain it with good\\nservice and repair, you won\\'t have to tell him to work well before he works\\nwell. He will automatically work well (bear fruit) because of the work of\\nChrist in us- \"He gave His life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse\\nus, and to make us His very own people, totally committed to doing good\\ndeeds.\" Titus 2:14.We are plugged in aka \"abide in Christ\" and get to bear\\nmuch fruit when we believe John 3:16; when we believe what Romans 5:9 says of\\nGod and how He sees us in Christ: \"And there is still much more to say of His\\nunfailing love for us! For through the blood of Jesus we have heard the\\npowerful declaration, “You are now righteous in My sight.” And because of the\\nsacrifice of Jesus, you will never experience the wrath of God.\" But fake\\npastors tell you who believe that you are no longer righteous and that you\\nwill still experience the wrath of God for the same sins that Christ died to\\nsave us from! Such tell you to \"do your best\" to keep the Law in order to get\\nright with God and remain in Christ- but this is how to get separated from\\nChrist as we see in Galatians 5:4-Remember John 15:5- \"For if you are trying\\nto make yourselves right with God by keeping the law you have been cut off\\nfrom Christ! You have fallen away from God\\'s grace.\"But Christ said “I am the\\nsprouting Vine and you’re My branches. As you live in union with Me as your\\nSource, fruitfulness will stream from within you—but when you live separated\\nfrom Me you are powerless.\"To live separated from Christ is to be powerless\\nand this happens when a person is trying to make himself right with God by\\nkeeping the law- smack where Satan wants everyone to be! Law and Grace cannot\\nmix: in order to depend on oneself (law-keeping) as a power source for\\ngodliness and right-living as many false doctrine preachers preach today, one\\nhas to be disconnected from the power Source that is Christ. That AC that is\\nman has only one power inlet- either by Law (human effort which is powerless\\naka the arm of flesh that will fail) or by Grace (undeserved, unearned,\\nunmerited favour.) Believer, run away from any pastor that preaches the\\nslightest dependence on human effort (law-keeping) for godliness. This is the\\nsame strategy that Satan used to seduce Eve in the garden of Eden when he told\\nher that she would be godly (be like God) by human effort at doing something.\\nSee the forbidden fruit as a picture of the law that many are trying so hard\\nto obey in order to be godly in Romans 7:8-12 (MSG) -\"Don’t you remember how\\nit was? I do, perfectly well. The law code started out as an excellent piece\\nof work. What happened, though, was that sin found a way to pervert the\\ncommand into a temptation, making a piece of “forbidden fruit” out of it. The\\nlaw code, instead of being used to guide me, was used to seduce me.\"Satan,\\nthrough his seemingly holy ministers behind many pulpits, is still seducing\\nmany by telling them that keeping the law (a picture of the tree of the\\nknowledge of good and evil) is how to be godly. Believer, flee from such false\\ndoctrines! Like the tree, the letter kills.Remember 1 Corinthians 10:13- \"And\\neach test is an opportunity to trust Him more,\"? Sometimes, God opens our eyes\\nto see how just how weak we are through our failures/sins as he did with\\nPeter. Peter\\'s three-time denial of Christ was an opportunity for him to see\\nthe futility of trusting himself. It made him see himself as we all are of\\nourselves. It made him trust in the Lord with all his heart - Christ restored\\nhim personally and powerfully. He was restored and transformed by Christ, not\\ncondemned. Judas on the other hand still depended on himself with his efforts\\nat restitution and he died.For anyone that believes that he is not sinning\\nbecause of his own will-power and wonders why \"some people just won\\'t stop\\nsinning,\" beware. Such are at the stage of Peter boasting that he would never\\ndeny Christ and even seeming to make progress in his resolve by slashing of\\nsomeone\\'s ear for Jesus. Confidence in human effort at doing right is folly.\\nThe arm of flesh will fail.Repeating laws that sinners already know by heart\\nand telling them to go and accomplish it by will-power is quite useless.\\nHearing the Law alone is not enough. Remember Deut. 28:15 says- \"However, if\\nyou do not obey the Lord your God and do not carefully follow all His commands\\nand decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come on you and\\novertake you:\" This verse is followed by a host of curses. Notice \"carefully\\nfollow all His commands\"? The \"all\" here is not just to fill up space. Those\\nwho are trying to keep the law in order to get the blessing of Abraham and\\nremain saved have to keep ALL of the Law. Nothing like \"I will do my best to\\nobey the Law and God will see that I have really tried and consider me and\\nbless me\" in the story of our salvation. This horrid mixture that is neither\\nLaw nor Grace is the \"neither cold nor hot\" that Christ spoke of in Revelation\\n3. One is either saved by Grace through faith or not saved at all. The law is\\nnot of faith. You have to be a doer of ALL the Law in order to escape the\\ncurse and have life by it. No one can be a doer by human effort. To be a doer,\\nyou have to do ALL. But James 2:10 says: \"For whosoever shall keep the whole\\nlaw yet stumble at one point, he is guilty of all.\" Most of us do not even\\nknow the over 600 laws of the Torah talk less of keeping them all. For any who\\ndepend on the Law: so you don\\'t fornicate or murder but you wish for your kids\\nto go to school abroad like Atiku\\'s kids? You are guilty of the tenth\\ncommandment- You shall not covet- and thus guilty of ALL. This might not seem\\nfair since murder is a worse sin.... until you realise that the reason why you\\nare not committing murder for a living is because you have not been tempted\\nbeyond what you can bear. Let\\'s not be like Peter who boasted that he would\\nnever deny Christ but ended up doing so three times. By grace, let\\'s see the\\nfutility of trusting in the flesh (human effort). Given the right\\ncircumstances, anybody is capable of committing the worst sins.Believer, let\\'s\\nbe for the Law for the purpose for which it was given: Romans 3:- \"19\\nObviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is\\nto keep people from having excuses, and to show that the entire world is\\nguilty before God. 20 For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what\\nthe law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.\" Also Galatians\\n3:19- \"Well then, why were the laws given? They were added after the promise\\nwas given, to show men how guilty they are of breaking God’s laws. But this\\nsystem of law was to last only until the coming of Christ, the Child to whom\\nGod’s promise was made....\" The law was not given for us to keep in order to\\nbe righteous or saved or \"make heaven.\" The law was given to show us how\\nsinful we are so we can see that we all need God\\'s saving Grace.The letter\\nkills. In fact, boasting in one\\'s ability to keep the Law like Peter did gives\\nSatan the opportunity to sift a person like wheat. Failure is always the\\nresult because “There is none righteous…” (Romans 3:10.) But pride in the arm\\nof flesh that will fail deceives many. Proverbs 16:18 counsels us:“Your boast\\nbecomes a prophecy of a future failure. The higher you lift up yourself in\\npride, the harder you’ll fall in disgrace.\" No sin is beneath anybody. The arm\\nof flesh will fail. The potential to commit heinous crimes is in everybody.\\nGod sees this potential and how favourable circumstances can make some people\\nthink that some sins are beneath them and that they can keep the law for\\nwhatever reason.This is what happens to anyone who is trying to keep the Ten\\nCommandments for Salvation:“For if you are trying to make yourselves right\\nwith God by keeping the law you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen\\naway from God\\'s grace.” Galatians 5:4.The Law is not of faith. Romans 3 says\\nof God: \"26...for He himself is fair and just, and He makes sinners right in\\nHis sight when they believe in Jesus. 27 Can we boast, then, that we have done\\nanything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on\\nobeying the law. It is based on faith. 28 So we are made right with God\\nthrough faith and not by obeying the law.\" In Christ, we are not under law but\\nunder Grace where sin shall not have dominion over you- \"For sin shall not\\nhave dominion over you for you are not under law but under Grace.\" Romans\\n6:14. But many have this verse backwards. The Law cannot save anybody or help\\nyou to live right. The Law makes no concessions for anybody. The Law will tell\\nyou what to do and all who try to get right with God by the law will fail:\\n\"For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands.\\nThe law simply shows us how sinful we are.\" Romans 3:20.Romans 7:6 says: \"Now,\\nhowever, we are free from the Law, because we died to that which once held us\\nprisoners.\"Mr. Law will adjudge you guilty, condemn and imprison you as soon\\nas you start a relationship with him for whatever reason. The letter kills.\\nPride in human effort (the arm of flesh) makes many believe that they can keep\\neven the tiniest bit of it…until God lifts His restraining hand and eyes get\\nopened like Peter\\'s did after he denied Christ.Bride of Christ, 1 Peter 2:3\\ntells us of our Bridegroom, Jesus Christ: \"By His divine power the Lord has\\ngiven us everything we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of\\nthe One who called us by His own honor and glory.”Under Grace, we have\\nEVERYTHING we need to live a life of moral excellence that exceeds even that\\nwhich the law demands THROUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST and NOT through the\\nknowledge of the law.Believer, NEVER TRUST YOURSELF. Trust in the Lord who\\nwill not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear and is the Way of escape\\nfrom every test, trial and temptation.Only when we receive God\\'s abundance of\\nGrace and His gift of righteousness to us in Christ do we get to “live in\\ntriumph over sin and death through the One, Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:17.When\\nthe love of God, expressed in His undeserved, unmerited favour (Grace - our\\nSaviour Jesus Christ) towards us, is unveiled from the pulpit, the people will\\nlive right. We love because He first loved us. Under Grace, we have all the\\nmoral excellence we need to live a life of morality. By Grace, let\\'s keep on\\nbelieving that \"By His divine power the Lord has given us everything we need\\nfor life and godliness through the knowledge of the One who called us by His\\nown honor and glory.”By grace, let’s keep on believing Galatians 5:1- “So\\nChrist has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don’t get\\ntied up again in slavery to the law.”In Christ, we have been freed from the\\nlaw, not so that we should go on sinning sprees as many who try to redefine\\nGod\\'s saving Grace say but that we should live in triumph over sin and death\\nthrough Jesus Christ:\"For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule\\nover many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and His gift of\\nrighteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death\\nthrough this one Man, Jesus Christ.\" Romans 5:17.Right believing always\\nproduces right living.http://rightbelieving101..com/2018/10/never-trust-\\nyourself-trust-in-christ.html?m=1\\n\\n',\n",

Your face is set on God like a flint and\\nthere is no going back. SCRIPTURE: Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:\\nbut I will maintain mine own ways before him. Job 13:15.THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:\\nWhen a person is deadly committed to God, backsliding is not an option; the\\npossibility of leaving God for other things does not exist.Dedication to God\\nis a primary duty of man. A major reason for dedication to God is that man’s\\ncreation was not his design; so, man’s existence must not follow man’s own\\ndesign (Isaiah 43:21). This means, we did not decide to be born, so we can’t\\ndecide how to live. You did not decide to be created, so you can’t decide how\\nto function. This is why we must be dedicated to God. Having known why we\\nshould be dedicated to God, it is important to know more of what dedication\\nimplies.Now, what is dedication? Dedication to God implies deadly commitment\\nto Him. Deadly commitment to God is a commitment unto death. It is a\\ncommitment of no return. Job said, Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him:\\nbut I will maintain mine own ways before him. (Job 13:15). Job seemed to say,\\n“Even if God killed me, I would still follow Him.”Ruth, a Moabite woman, told\\nNoami, her mother-in-law, “…Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from\\nfollowing after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou\\nlodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:\\nWhere thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to\\nme, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me” (Ruth 1:16-17). This\\nis how someone can be with God in deadly commitment to Him. When a person is\\ndeadly committed to God, backsliding is not an option; the possibility of\\nleaving God for other things does not exist. Your face is set on God like a\\nflint and there is no going back. Going back from following God is not a\\ntemptation. If you are deadly committed to God, you won’t follow anyone to\\njoin an occult group in order to become rich. Beloved, when you are deadly\\ncommitted to God, you don’t need people’s encouragement to follow God. Rather,\\nyou make following God the sole aim of your existence. May God give you the\\ngrace to be deadly committed to Him in Jesus’ Name.Remember this: When a\\nperson is deadly committed to God, backsliding is not an option; the\\npossibility of leaving God for other things does not exist.

              "  'response': 'Here\\'s an excerpt from a related thread:Sinning willfully can only be\\ncorrectly defined in the context of the text. Also consider how drastic it is\\nthat Paul says there is no sacrifice remaining for such a sin and hence no\\nforgiveness except fearful judgement(Heb10:26-27).Actually, contrary to his\\naim, @OP picked a text that contravenes eternal security. So first off, who\\nwas Paul referring to? Paul was certainly referring to those who were\\nbelievers already but we\\'re pressured to abandon faith by persecution from\\nneighbouring Jews, as shown in the preceding verseHebrews 10:25[25]Not\\nforsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but\\nexhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.The\\nsucceeding verses also confirm he referred to believers, the only people who\\ncould ever have been sanctified by the blood of the Son.Hebrews 10:29[29]Of\\nhow much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has\\nrejected with disdain the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the\\ncovenant with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has insulted the\\nSpirit of grace?So what exactly is the willful sin? It is not just any sin a\\nbeliever commits, of course. It is only the sin of apostasy- an outright\\nturning back on faith in the Lord that one once held(which faith is the only\\nmeans of salvation) i.e. when the believer no longer wants Jesus as his Lord.\\nWe also see that this apostasy called \"insulting the Spirit of grace\" in\\nHeb10:29 was what the Lord called blasphemy of the Holy Spirit which can never\\nbe forgiven:Luke 12:10[10]And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of\\nman(unbelievers), it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemes the\\nHoly Spirit, it shall not be forgivenThis sin is also what John calls the \"sin\\nunto [eternal]death\" which when a brother commits, there is no room for\\nforgiveness, hence no recommendation to pray for such(1Jn5:16). It leads\\ninstantly to (eternal)death(1Jn5:16). Every other sin doesn\\'t instantly lead\\nto eternal death(1Jn5:17) but can lead to the delusion of committing this sin\\nif allowed to harden the heart, by continuing in them(Heb3:13)1Jn 5:16-17 KJV\\n16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask,\\nand he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin\\nunto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 17 All unrighteousness is\\nsin: and there is a sin not unto death.Not every believer qualifies to commit\\nthis sin but only one who has passed through all stages of spiritual\\ndevelopment mentioned in Heb6:4-6 which can be summarised as having made Jesus\\nLord first and then having been baptized into the Holy Spirit with the\\nevidence of spiritual gifts of power/anointing. Heb 6:4-6 KJV 4 For it is\\nimpossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly\\ngift, and became sharers of the Holy Spirit, 5 And have tasted the good word\\nof God, and the powers of the age to come, 6 If they shall fall away, to renew\\nthem again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God\\nafresh, and put him to an open shame.It is however very rare for a true\\nbeliever to commit such a sin.It is noteworthy that the impossibility of\\nredeeming such believers is not because God\\'s mercy can ever be exhausted but\\nbecause sin automatically hardens the conscience hence a believer who\\ncontinues in sin to a certain point becomes totally hardened in heart and\\ndeceived by sin(Heb3:13) such that he himself no more wants to retain faith in\\nthe Lord for security of his soul. Which faith alone is the only basis to\\nenjoy God\\'s provision of salvation.Hence the unforgivable sin is apostasy\\na.k.a. blasphemy(insult) of the Holy Spirit a.k.a. sin unto [eternal]death\\na.k.a. willful sin.A simple test every believer can take to check if they have\\ncommitted this sin is whether or not you still have a desire to have your sins\\ncleansed by the Lord. If you do, no matter how many sins you have committed,\\nyou haven\\'t committed the unforgivable. But if you no longer want Jesus, His\\nmercy and cleansing in your life, then you have.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Lunar Eclipse on 4th of July: A Warning to Nations, Israel according to\\n100-Year-Old ProphecyThe penumbral lunar eclipse will be the final of three\\nconsecutive astronomical events constituting a complete “eclipse season.” On\\nJune 5, a penumbral eclipse was visible in Asia, Australia, Europe, and\\nAfrica. On June 21, an annular “Ring of Fire” solar eclipse was visible in\\nAfrica and Asia, including the Central African Republic, Congo, Ethiopia,\\nsouthern Pakistan, northern India, and China. Rabbi Yosef Berger, the rabbi of\\nKing Davids Tomb on Mount Zion, emphasized that a lunar eclipse can clearly\\ncontain a message from God. He cited Genesis as the source. Hashem said, “Let\\nthere be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they\\nshall serve as signs for the set times—the days and the years; Genesis 1:14The\\nrabbi noted that the interpretation of these “signs” will be essential in the\\ndays preceding the Final Redemption as God’s intent will be expressed in\\nnature. “The sun and the moon are how God will announce the Final Redemption,\\nso everyone can see and everyone will have the ruach hakodesh (holy spirit,\\nprophetic ability) to understand,” Rabbi Berger explained. “This was also true\\nbefore the Exodus in Egypt, when all the Jews were given the prophetic ability\\nto understand that it was time. Unfortunately, even then, some chose not to\\nleave Egypt.”“A modern man does not understand how God appears in nature, how\\nGod speaks to us through nature,” Rabbi Berger said. “To the prophets, this\\nwas very clear.”The rabbi referred to a discussion of eclipses in the Talmud\\n(Sukkot 29a) which specifies that lunar eclipses are a bad omen for Israel\\nsince Israel is spiritually represented by the moon. If the lunar eclipse\\ntakes place in the east side of the heavens, then it is a bad omen for all the\\nnations in the east, and similarly, if it occurs in the western hemisphere of\\nthe sky, it is a bad sign for all the nations in the west.The rabbi cited\\nYalkut Moshe, a book of kabbalistic insights written in 1894 by Rabbi Moshe\\nben Yisrael Benyamin in Munkacs, Poland.“If the moon is eclipsed in the month\\nof Tammuz, a ‘sultan’ will die suddenly and great troubles will follow,” Rabbi\\nBerger quoting yet another esoteric source. The eclipse will occur on the 12th\\nday of the month of Tammuz. “When the moon is eclipsed in Tammuz, a king of\\n‘luazi’ will die suddenly and a great confusion will follow, leading to great\\nproblems.”“Luazi” is generally translated as foreign, as seen in the Book of\\nPsalms.When Yisrael went forth from Egypt, the house of Yaakov from a people\\nof strange (foreign) speech. Psalms 114:1“This clearly refers to troubles for\\nthe non-Jews,” Rabbi Berger said, citing the Talmud. “The word ‘sultan’ is not\\ngenerally used. It is only used in reference to Arab leaders. And since the\\nMuslims mark their months only by the moon, this seems to be a sign for them,\\nthose who built the gold dome that sits atop the Holy of Holies.”At the end of\\nthis section describing the omens contained within eclipses, the Talmud states\\na disclaimer: “When Israel does the will of the place (God), they have nothing\\nto fear from all of this,” citing the Prophet Jeremiah as a source.Thus said\\nHashem: Do not learn to go the way of the nations, And do not be dismayed by\\nportents in the sky; Let the nations be dismayed by them! Jeremiah 10:2Rabbi\\nBerger noted that the lunar eclipse comes just a few days after the Knesset is\\ngoing to vote on annexing parts of Judea and Samaria. The vote comes as a\\nresult of a coalition deal between Netanyahu, head of the Likud Party, and his\\npolitical opponent, Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White Party. As per the\\nagreement, the government can pursue annexation of 132 Jewish cities and towns\\nand the Jordan Valley. This represents 30 % of the West Bank allocated to\\nIsrael under the Trump administration’s peace plan.

              "  'content': 'How God Taught Me About Prosperityhow-god-taught-me-about-prosperity//Kenneth\\nE. HaginI left my last pastorate in 1949 and went out in field ministry, going\\nfrom church to church holding revivals. After I’d been out on the field a\\nsolid year, from February 1949 to January 1950, my records showed I’d earned\\n$1,200 less than my church had paid me for the previous 12 months.Plus, the\\nchurch had furnished our parsonage, which was the best we’d ever lived in.\\nThey also paid the utilities and all of my expenses to conventions. And they\\nwere always buying clothing and other gifts for my wife and me.After I went\\nout on my own, I had to pay my own rent, utilities, and convention expenses,\\nas well as my traveling expenses to and from meetings.The subject of\\nprosperity is currently so misunderstood in the church world. The Lord Himself\\ntaught me about prosperity. I never read a book about it; I got it directly\\nfrom Heaven. It blessedme and my family so much I want to share it with\\nyou.During that first year on the field, my clothes and my car had worn out.\\nThe car had four bald tires and no spare. In fact, it got so bad I sold it for\\njunk! We lived in a three-room apartment. Ken, our son, didn’t have a bedroom\\nand had to sleep on a little rollaway bed in the kitchen!I was holding a\\nmeeting in East Texas when I went to the Lord about our financial problems. I\\nwent on a partial fast, and each afternoon I spent several hours in prayer. On\\nthe third day, I had all my statistics laid out in front of me and said to the\\nLord, “See how much better off I’d be if I stayed in my church? That’s what\\nIwanted to do anyhow.”I’d gotten hold of Isaiah 1:19, “If ye be willing and\\nobedient, ye shall eat the good of the land,” and I quoted it to the Lord\\nagain. I reminded Him that I had earned $1,200 less than the last church I\\npastored had paid me. I reminded Him that my clothes had worn out and I was on\\nfoot without a car.I kept saying, “Lord, You said right here in your Word, ‘If\\nye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land,’ and I am not\\neating the good of the land. My children are not adequately fed. We are not\\nadequately housed. I know the problem is not with You because You don’t ever\\nchange. Where is the problem?”The still, small voice of the Lord spoke to my\\nspirit, my innermost being: “The reason you are not eating the good of the\\nland is that you don’t qualify. You are obedient, but you aren’t willing. So\\nyou don’t qualify to eat the good of the land.” I made a little adjustment\\ndown on the inside of me and got willing in 10 seconds! But then the Lord had\\nto correct my thinking. Wrong thinking defeats us a lot of times. Our minds\\nare filled with what we’ve been taught, whether it’s scriptural or not.The\\nLord said to me, “Go back to the Book of Beginnings.” (I knew He was talking\\nabout the Book of Genesis.) “You know I made my man Adam?” he\\ncontinued.“Yes.”“Adam originally was the god of this world. He ruled and\\ndominated it. That’s the way I planned it. When Adam sold out to Satan, then\\nSatan became the god of this world (2 Cor. 4:4). I’m not withholding adequate\\nfood and clothing from your little children—that’s not Me! It’s the devil.\\nHe’s the god of this world.“The money you need is on the earth. I’m not going\\nto rain money down from Heaven. I don’t have any money up here. And if I did\\nrain money down, it would be counterfeit, and I’m not a counterfeiter. The\\nsilver and gold are down on the earth where you need it.”“Then what should I\\ndo?” I asked.“In the first place,” He replied, “don’t pray anymore about money\\nthe way you have been praying.“Number one, claim whatever you want or need,\\nbecause it’s down there on the earth. And Satan has the most control of\\nit.”“Now, Lord,” I said, “I can believe that You want to meet our needs—but\\nour wants?”He replied, “You claim to be a stickler for the Word. In the23rd\\nPsalm it says, ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not WANT’ (v. 1). And it says\\nin the 34th Psalm, ‘The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that\\nseek the Lord shall not WANT any good thing’ (v. 10).“Number two,” the Lord\\ncontinued, “say, ‘Satan, take your hands off my money.’ It’s Satan who is\\nkeeping it from coming to you—not me. And number three, say, ‘Go, ministering\\nspirits, and cause the money to come.’ Ministering spirits are sent to serve\\nyou. Did you ever read in the Book of Hebrews where it says thatangels are\\n‘ministering spirits, sent forth to minister FOR them who shall be heirs of\\nsalvation’ (Heb. 1:14)?”I could see it then: for years, angels had been\\nstanding around me doing nothing because I had never told them to do\\nanything.Before the Lord spoke to me, I would pray, fast, weep, and cry and\\nstill barely skim by. But I got right up off my knees and went into the\\nchurch. (I was staying in the parsonage next door.) With fear and trembling, I\\nstood on the platform in that empty church and said, “I claim $150 this week.\\nSatan, take your hands off myfinances. Go, ministering spirits, and cause the\\nmoney to come.”I knew enough about faith to know that that settled it. There\\nwas no use repeating it, so I walked out of the church and back to my room.I\\nreceived the money that week. I tested this out time and time again, and I got\\nthe money I claimed every time. What about your situation? The same thing is\\ntrue concerning you. If you’ll follow these steps, it will work for you too.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': \"The story surrounding the former EFCC boss, Mr. Ibrahim Magu is no longer new,\\nhence there is no need dissipating much energy in flogging an already dead\\nhorse. One of the biggest fake news in Nigeria today as carried by a\\ngovernment agency, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) is the alleged involvement of\\na Prophet of God, Pastor Emmanuel Omale. One wonders why a renowned government\\nnews outlet would descend so low as to engage in peddling fake news aimed at\\nrubbishing the hard earned reputation of the man of God. Indeed, It is good\\nnews that the National Assembly is busy pushing for social media controls in\\nNigeria.Prophet Emmanuel Omale is not an accidental Prophet of God, but a\\ncreation of God Almighty with special gifts. For those who know him from “Our\\nLady Of Schools” Anyigba, the current prophetic activities of Prophet Omale\\nare not new. There is no amount of fake news that would bring down a man born\\nwith special anointing as this. The design of NAN is similar to the activities\\nof Pharaoh whose purpose was to truncate God's prophecy for humanity. Let it\\nbe known that there is no amount of media abracadabra that would frustrate\\nGod's mission.Although the man of God through his lawyer has sought the\\nretraction of the fake and malicious news, there is urgent need for\\nconstituted authorities to check how media houses are being used by some\\nelements to achieve devilish personal purposes such as linking Prophet\\nEmmanuel Omale with being used by the former EFCC boss to buy property and\\nmoney laundry. It is not just ridiculous but has already put a question mark\\non the indictment of Magu without trial. Yes, media trial in Nigeria is no\\nlonger news but while engaging in such dirty assignments, there are some\\nindividuals that must be spared as a result of their pedigree, and Prophet\\nEmmanuel Omale is one of such.While the News Agency of Nigeria is yet to\\nopenly retract the reckless and malicious publication, the Nation Newspaper\\nhas openly tendered an apology to the respected ilk, Chief Femi Falana who was\\nalso accused of collecting 28 million naira from the embattled EFCC czar. The\\npetition from Magu to Justice Ayo Salami-led probe panel has once again\\nreminded us of the need for the media houses to tread with caution as\\nreputation is very key.It is shocking that the government that is calling for\\nmedia censorship and control is directly guilty of the same offense. Before\\nnow, it was widely believed that news media (social media) took the lead in\\nspreading fake news but with a renowned media house like NAN involved in this\\nmisleading and misinformation assignment, it is obvious we have a lot of war\\nto fight against fake news.It is on this basis that we hereby conclude that\\nthe report being referenced is yet another cheap attempt by an uninformed\\nwriter/journalist whose only aim is to achieve prominence by bringing the\\nperson of an exceptional prophet from childhood to disrepute.Consequently, we\\ncondemn and discard the report in its entirety as it is totally false and\\nmisleading. We also kindly advise Nigerians to do same and see this as a\\nreiteration of prophet Emmanuel Omale’s unquestionable\\nIntegrity.https://www.inform.ng/post/magus-ordeals-why-prophet-emmanuel-omale-\\nshould-forgive-agents-of-fake-news-josiah-abuh\\n\\n\",\n",

Many entrepreneurs and strikingly rich individuals have shared\\nthe secret of their wealth, and more than often, the big secret is hard work\\nand an opportunity, no matter how little it might look. In my terms I call\\nentrepreneurs “intelligent opportunists”. So is the devil.The bible likened\\nhim to a roaring lion looking for whom to devour (1), more skilled than the\\nmost successful entrepreneur, he comes into a man’s life looking for an\\nopportunity to ensnare him in the web of destruction. He is no respecter of\\npersons or anointing, once he finds an opportunity he latches on it and does\\nhis dirty work.This is why the bible says 2 Corinthians 2:11-Lest the devil\\nshould get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. KJVWe\\ncan learn from the life of some bible personalities.AbrahamAbraham, the father\\nof faith and a friend of God, carried the seed of the promised child in his\\nloins.The literal expression of the promised child was Isaac while the\\ncovenant expression was our Lord Jesus Christ. Despite Abraham's faith, the\\ndevil found an opportunity in his life. The opportunity was Hagar, the\\nEgyptian woman, who was Sarah's hand maid. Sarah must have thought making\\nHagar Abraham's wife was a great idea (2), she didn't know that the seemingly\\ninnocent piece of advice was against God's plan hence the conclusion that that\\nher adviser was the devil. The result of this decision to her and the world at\\nlarge is enormous.SamsonSamson’s case is a peculiar one, the tale of his\\nweakness for strange women will be forever told.Samson was a Nazarite from\\nbirth, his life was guided by a set of rules. He knew the what (that is, who\\nhe is and how he should live) but he did not know the why (that is, why he was\\nwho God made him to be). Samson had no sense of purpose which is probably why\\nhe gave himself to strange women. The devil saw this and robbed him of his\\ndivine destiny.Samson’s destiny was to deliver the Israelite from the hand of\\nthe Philistines (3), he failed to fulfill this . King David had the\\nopportunity to give testimonies of his victory against the Philistines because\\nof Samson’s failure.DavidKing David is the apple of God’s eyes. Despite his\\nnumerous exploits and his being an ancestor of the Lord Jesus Christ, his\\nsexual affair with Bathsheba and killing of her husband Uriah scars his\\nsuccess record before heaven. David was supposed to be at battle but his\\ncarelessness and negligence of duty caused him to promote pleasures above\\nresponsibility. The devil, who is so skillful with his tactics took that\\nopportunity to lure David to make the greatest mistake of his life. Till date,\\nhis descendants are still bearing the consequence (4). We can see a common\\ntrend in the devil's attack on these individuals. He did not just attack to\\nhurt them or make them regret their decisions, but to make mistakes which\\naffected generations ahead of them and the world at largeAs believers, we have\\nnothing to fear. Still we need to be at alert, to watch and pray. Submit your\\nwill to His will and He will be your hope and stay.

A parable is both an effective and memorable vehicle\\nfor the conveyance of divine truth. Needless to say, one major advantage that\\nthey have is that they are easily remembered.In Jesus' earthly ministry, He\\ncontinuously taught in parables. Until recently, I've always believed the\\nreason why Jesus taught in parables was to conceal truth and confound the\\nunbelieving Jews.Many, just like me came to this wrong conclusion because of\\nthe way we read and interpret Matthew 13:10-15:“And the disciples came, and\\nsaid unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said\\nunto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom\\nof heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him shall be\\ngiven, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him\\nshall be taken away even that he hath. Therefore speak I to them in parables:\\nbecause they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they\\nunderstand. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By\\nhearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and\\nshall not perceive: For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are\\ndull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should\\nsee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with\\ntheir heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.”\\u202d\\u202dIt appears\\nfrom this rendition of the KJV that Jesus is deliberately hiding the mystery\\nof God's kingdom from some set of people. However, this is not the case, as\\nthis translation, if not carefully read and understood, could be\\nmisleading.Come to think of it, Jesus is the Light of the world. Light\\nsymbolises knowledge. The utmost desire and drive of Light is to abundantly\\ndispense knowledge without holding anything back. Obviously, the hearts of the\\npeople were already hardened. So, there's no sane reason why Jesus will teach\\nthem in parables to make the hearts more hardened. Clearly, Jesus's aim in\\nteaching in parables was not to prevent the people from understanding Him, but\\nto nudge the people toward receptive insight.\\n\\n\",\n",
              "  'response': '[quote author=iKingsley post=90568918]Any explanation that is not straight can\\nmean so many things. Let\\'s start with Matthew 13:10-12: “And the disciples\\ncame, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered\\nand said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the\\nkingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.”\\u202d\\u202dMatthew\\u202c \\u202d13:10-11\\u202c \\u202dKJV\\u202c\\u202c\\nThe disciples were wondering why Jesus taught the people in parables instead\\nof using plain speech just as He used to teach them in private. See how Jesus\\nresponded in v11-\"Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the\\nkingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.\"Seems Jesus was saying, you\\nhave been chosen to understand the parables but the meaning of the parable is\\ndeliberately hidden from the people.No, not really.He was basically saying,\\nJust because you\\'re privileged to understand God\\'s kingdom, and how it works,\\nyou must realize that it’s not everyone that has the insight. You’re\\nprivileged to know because I take time to expound the parables to you when\\nalone with you. As a result, you’re way ahead of them because your mind is\\nprepared or made ready. Because you have a ready mind for this, the insights\\nand understanding flow easily. But they are not presented with the same\\nopportunity, where they are taught in the secret. Thus, their heart is\\nhardened and unresponsive.Then you’ll probably assume that they’re been\\npunished in v12......12. “For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he\\nshall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken\\naway even that he hath.”What do the disciples have which the people do not\\nhave?A ready heart! A heart that has been prepared to receive deeper\\ntruth.Since there is no readiness/ preparedness in the heart of the people,\\nthey lose any trace of receptivity. But the one that has , that is, has the\\nreadiness, such receives more insights and understanding.It’s just like a man\\nthat has gone on a 7-day fasting without food. This man is not expected to\\nbreak his fast with pounded yam. He must break with something light, so that\\nthe system can digest something heavier later. So Jesus starts His teachings\\nwith the light food ( parables) so as to create an appetite or readiness for\\ndeeper understanding and insights.In essence, He taught the people in parables\\nto create this readiness which will nudge the people toward receptive insight\\n.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': '...Says Orji Kalu is next Nigerian president after BuhariA Nigerian cleric,\\nProphet Joshua Arogun has revealed that a major conspiracy by three\\ninfluential Nigerians led to the jailing of former Governor Orji Uzor Kalu,\\nIgbere TV reports.According to a report by the Nigeria Daily, the cleric added\\nthat one of them is dead, the second is facing national and international\\nembarrassment and the third will suffer worse fate.Joshua, who is the General\\nOverseer of Light of the World International Church, made the revelations on\\nSunday during the church’s ministration service in Lagos.His words, “During\\none of our monthly intensive prayers for Nigeria in 2019, I received a\\nshocking message on the political situations of the country. I saw three very\\npowerful Nigerians who were conspiring heavily to make sure that a former\\ngovernor from the South East was jailed. I told my wife about it and we both\\nprayed and sought for a clearer interpretation of the revelation. I got the\\nthree names and tried my best to reach out to the three of them after I\\nreceived another very clear and fearful message of the harm that would befall\\nthem if they don’t retrace their steps. But I was ignored. “One of them told\\nPastor Emmanuel (referring to a fellow pastor in the church) that he doesn’t\\nbelieve in prophecy, our religion and the message; the second person totally\\nignored the message. I told them that the person they want to disgrace is a\\nman of grace from birth and the consequences of their trial will be so heavy\\non them.”Speaking further, he said “After many months in the 2019, I heard\\nthat former governor Orji Kalu was sentenced to jail. Today, one of the\\nconspirators is dead, the second person is facing national and international\\nembarrassment and the third person who is even here in Lagos with us is going\\nto suffer worse fate.“There is this thing about grace and it is given from\\nabove. Sometimes when you touch a wrong person with overflowing grace, it\\nwould backfire. They want to destroy him because of his destiny to be\\nPresident. But anyone planning evil on him will suffer the same fate as\\nothers”, Prophet Joshua was quoted as saying. The Popular cleric also told the\\ncongregation that his greatest duty is to reveal the message as received\\nadding that it is up to the people involved to do the right thing. “I have\\nnever met any of them but the message would definitely get to them. Nigerian\\npoliticians are yet to understand that it is God that gives power not humans\\nor godfathers. If God says it is you, then it is you. Nobody can stop it. When\\nthey try to stop it they end up pushing you closer to your destiny”, he added.\\nIgbere TV recalls that Prophet Joshua was in the news in 2014 when he\\ncontroversially predicted President Buhari’s victory in the 2015 general\\nelection. Prophet Joshua who predicted Senator Orji Kalu’s release from\\nprison, insists that he is the next president after Buhari. His words then,\\n“For the upcoming 2015 election, God told me that Buhari would win. And God\\ntold me a lot of things about Buhari. It is He that anointed him to be the\\npresident and there is no questions about that. No one can change it. The\\npeople can hate him: the people can reject him but God has ordained him, and\\nthere is something about God. When He says that you would be this, no man can\\nchange it. He does what pleases Him.”Similarly in March 1, 2020, Prophet\\nJoshua had stated that a former governor who was imprisoned and was serving\\nhis jail terms would be released and become the President of Nigeria after\\nBuhari. Many believed he was referring to ex-Governor Orji Uzor Kalu who was\\nat the time serving his 12 years jail term. However, in a twist of fate and in\\ncredence to the prophesy just like that of Buhari, the Supreme Court on May 8\\nnullified the judgment that sentenced Kalu to 12 years imprisonment and the\\nformer governor was set free.https://igberetvnews.com/1357795/breaking-\\nprophet-joshua-names-three-nigerians-suffer-orji-kalus-sake/Lalasticlala Seun\\nMynd44\\n\\n',\n",

Speaking further, the WHO\\nDirector General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus added that faith and science should\\n“go together”. “We know many religious leaders who would really advise their\\nfollowers to follow their faith and at the same time use science. The two do\\nnot contradict; they go together… We will call on all religious leaders to be\\nin this fight and save lives,” he stated.Ghebreyesus had earlier echoed TB\\nJoshua’s prophecy where he declared 2020 “the year of humility” in which “God\\nwould humble us with our challenges”.“If this virus is teaching us anything,\\nit is humility,” the former Ethiopian Minister of Health asserted.Emmanuel\\nTV’s popular YouTube videos, many of which show similar case of miraculous\\nhealing through prayer, have accumulated over six hundred million views.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xPSbFU43PU\\n\\n',\n",

I went to one of the most expensive shops in New York. I tried on, up to five beautiful wedding gowns before making my final choice.I settled for a tube like gown that had a small jacket on it. In excitement, I returned to my Aunty's house clutching my wedding gown on my chest.That night in my sleep, I had a dream. A man in a silk robe sat in front of me and began to chat me up.The conversation went thus:Stranger: Why did you choose that wedding gown?Me: It was the one that fitted me best.Stranger: Do you know that half of your breast was revealed when you wore it?Me: But there is a jacket to cover the exposed part of my breast.Stranger: When you get to the reception, will you not remove the jacket?Me: Removing the jacket at the reception is the fun of the gown. Stranger: With your breast out for public consumption?Me: But we would have left Church. Stranger: At the reception, will there not be unbelievers there who will blaspheme my name? Those who will say see what she is wearing, and she calls herself a Christian.Me: People don't think like that anymore. More so it is this tube like gowns that are reigning now.Stranger: You seem to be adamant on wearing the tube.. What if I ask you to return it and pick a decent one that covers the upper part of your body?Me: But I like this one. I'm not sure I want to return it.Stranger: You are my precious daughter and I know you would not like to hurt me just as I would not like to hurt you.Me: Who are you, please?Stranger: I am the Holy Spirit, and your body is my temple. Keep my temple holy and I will keep your marriage holy. I will also keep your body holy. If you insist on wearing it, can you cope with breast cancer?Me: Breast cancer?I woke up sweating. By mid-day, I returned the gown to pick one that would not expose my breast.There in that shop, I met the daughter of a very popular King in Nigeria. We got talking and I saw that she did not even go to the section of tube styles. When I asked her why she did not try on the tube style, she said My father (the King) will never allow it. He says *'Royalty does not dress indecently. '*I learnt an eternal lesson that day. First from the Holy Spirit and two, from an earthly royal princess.ROYALTY DOES NOT DRESS INDECENTLY.IF YOU KEEP DRESSING WITH YOUR BREAST EXPOSED, CAN YOU STAND A BREAST CANCER LATER IN LIFE?Maranatha!\\n\\n\",\n",

I had baby\\ntoys.I bathed them.Fed them.Backed them.Put them to sleep when they \\'fretted\\'I\\nrecall putting my dolls to my flat chest to give them suck.I was grooming for\\nmy role later in life.I was made to help out in the kitchen.

In your\\nhusband\\'s house...\"\"When you have your children...\" We watched our mothers\\npracticalize what they taught us, so, it wasn\\'t just empty lectures. Today, we\\nare where our mothers used to be and we are repeating history. Teaching our\\ngirls to be ladies, wives, mothers. But who is teaching the boys Who is\\nteaching them to be good men, gentlemen, husbands, fathers? A properly raised\\nlady meets a badly raised man in marriage. That marriage is dead on arrival.A\\ngirl was practically raised learning how to keep a home and submit to her\\nhusband. But who helped raise a boy teaching him how to love his wife and earn\\nrespect and submission?Who is raising the boys to know that it is okay to\\nenter the kitchen and cook for his wife and kids? Who is teaching them that\\nthey can also make their beds? Do their laundry? Help with groceries? Before\\nyou label me an extreme feminist, hear me out.

That it is not cast in\\nstone for them to be served on the dinning table and for their dishes to be\\ncleared after meals? That they should wake up at dawn like the girls do and\\nclean the car or do some other house chores as well? That they can cook for\\nthe family? That they can do the groceries?

If you fall, first admit sorrowfully that you have made a mistake,\\nthen go to God pleading for mercy. David was a man who had godly sorrow, that\\nis when even though he made many mistakes in his lifetime, he kept on moving\\nforward. He said in Psalm 51:3:“For I acknowledge my transgression; and my sin\\nis ever before me.”Several times in the scripture when David made a mistake,\\nthe Bible says his heart smote him. You will not make progress if you are\\nalways shifting blame. Only failures make excuses.Godly sorrow leads you to\\nlearn from your mistakes. David never repeated any of his mistakes because he\\nwas truly sorry for his sins. If for instance, you fall into fornication\\nbecause you were close friends with someone of the opposite sex, godly sorrow\\nwill alert you the next time you are getting close to someone who could make\\nyou fall, so you can break off that relationship.Having godly sorrow does not\\nmean feeling rejected by God when you do wrong. The feeling of rejection is a\\ntrap of the devil to keep us out of God’s light. 1st John 1:9 says:“If we\\nconfess out sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to\\ncleanse us from all unrighteousness.”God is always happy to forgive and\\nreconnect with anyone who has erred from the faith, as long as they confess\\ntheir sins. When God has had mercy on you and welcomed you back into His\\nlight, you must run away from anything that can make you fall again. The\\ndoctrine of grace which teaches that you can continue in sin once you are born\\nagain is a strategy of the devil to eradicate godly sorrow.

              "  'content': \"BEING IN TUNEIf you are driving from Lagos to Ibadan, a journey of about\\n120klm, and you tune to your favourite radio station in your vehicle, for\\nexample LAGOS 97.5 FM; as you are driving around Lagos the radio station will\\nbe very clear. But you will discover that as you move a bit far away from\\nLagos, the radio wave will be getting noisy as if wing is carrying it on and\\noff, and it will get to a particular point that you will not be able to hear\\nwhat they are saying on the radio clearly again because you are driving far\\naway from Lagos where the radio station is located. Along the journey it will\\nget to a point where you will not hear any word or music from the radio\\nstation again except the noise. And by the time you get to the city of Ibadan,\\nyou may be surprised that you will be hearing another station picked up from\\nthat same 97.5 FM, but no longer LAGOS FM, it is another radio station in\\nIbadan. This is the illustration the Lord gave me when we were praying in the\\nfellowship about our relationship and connection with Holy Spirit. Let me\\nexplain details to you below:DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONNECTION WITH HOLY SPIRIT1.\\nFull ConnectionWhen you repent and become born again, the Holy Spirit enters\\ninto your life and becomes your Companion, Great Teacher and Comforter; you\\nare in tune with the Holy Spirit, and as long you maintain intimacy with Him\\nthrough reading and meditating the Word of God, praying, obeying the Word of\\nGod and following the leading of the Holy Spirit; you will remain in tune with\\nthe Holy Spirit the Great Comforter and Teacher. In such situation you are in\\nclear connection with Holy Spirit, you can hear Him leading you and guiding\\nyou in all your ways. You don’t need a prophet to tell you the mind of God,\\nHis Spirit is already in you speaking clearly to you and leading you. He tells\\nyou how to pray, what to pray, and sometimes, when to pray. And it is the same\\nHoly Spirit that will help you to make the Rapture when it happens.2. Fading\\nConnectionThis is a situation where a Believer is not fully connected or in\\ntune with the Holy Spirit, when the noises of the world, of the flesh and of\\nSatan begin to compete with the voice of Holy Spirit because such believer is\\nmoving a bit far away from the Holy Spirit. When half obedience is replacing\\nfull obedience, when prayer life, Bible reading life, and evangelism life is\\nnot growing but rather going down; when a believer begins to toil with sin and\\ncalls sin a moderate, acceptable names. Such a believer cannot hear the voice\\nof the Spirit clearly, not too far but not very close. 3, Faraway\\nDisconnectionThis is a point where many Christians have gone far from the Holy\\nSpirit that they only hear the noise of the world, no voice of the Spirit of\\nGod and no melody of spiritual things again. Consistently grieving the Holy\\nSpirit, continuous confessing and committing sin, becoming friendly with\\nworldly styles and ways, refusing to repent immediately as the Holy Spirit\\ncorrects you, inconsistent prayer life, skipping Bible reading and forgetting\\nabout evangelism among others lead to this stage of disconnection from the\\nHoly Spirit.When the things of God look boring to you and the Holy Spirit\\nseems far away from you, it means you are no longer in tune with the Holy\\nSpirit, you have gone far from His reach and coverage. Many Christians are in\\nthis level of faraway disconnection from the Holy Spirit, but they are still\\nmaking noise of speaking in tongues, of old testimonies, of paying tithes and\\nofferings and occupying positions in the church; many are being deceived by\\nthe noise of empty prayer life and church activities without connection with\\nthe Holy Spirit again. Un-repented sins and continuous disobedience to the\\nHoly Spirit keep many away from full connection of Holy Spirit. This is not\\nthe last level of connection in Christian life, it's the number 4:4, Familiar\\nSpirit Re-connectionJust like the illustration the Lord gave me of a person\\nwho tunes his car’s stereo to LAGOS 97.5 FM in Lagos and driving to Ibadan, by\\nthe time he gets to Ibadan, though his car stereo still tunes to 97.5, but\\nanother radio station will take over in Ibadan. This is the worst and most\\ndangerous level a Christian can be in the spirit. When a Christian gets to\\nlevel 3 of faraway disconnection from the Holy Spirit, and such Christian\\nrefuses to retrace his way back to Bethel where he met Christ, to the\\nterritory of Holy Spirit connection, then the devil will take over completely;\\neven though on his car stereo he still tunes to 97.5, but another radio\\nstation is operating in the wave.Many Christians and ministries today are\\nunder the manipulation and control of familiar spirit of the forces of\\ndarkness but they still think it is the Holy Spirit whereas Holy Spirit has\\nlong time ago disconnected from them. As it is applicable to Christian\\nmembers, so it is to Christian ministers, even though they still pray, preach\\nand dress like before, though they still speak in tongues and perform\\nmiracles, yet they are under the control of another spirit.A long time far\\naway from the Holy Spirit gives way to familiar spirit to take over, and this\\nis the most terrible situation where there is no more condemnation of evil,\\nwhere the conscience is seared, where the flesh takes over, where truth is\\nseen as false and lie is defended as truth; when a Christian easily flows with\\nthe world.You remember king Saul in the Bible? He started with the fullness of\\nthe Spirit of God but ended with familiar spirit. When he got to the point of\\nfaraway disconnection, instead of him to retrace his way back to God and\\nrepent, he continued going farther away from God until he got reconnected with\\na familiar spirit and had a disastrous ending. Many Christians and ministers\\nare following the steps of King Saul even till today.A TIMELY WARNING!When you\\nthink you are still in tune with a spirit giving you confidence in your sin\\nand worldliness, it is a familiar spirit of the devil manipulating you, not\\nthe Holy Spirit, because Holy Spirit does not abide in sin.When you are still\\nhearing a voice speaking to you to ignore Bible warnings, and the spirit is\\ndefending you and pushing you to continue in ungodly ways and worldliness, it\\nis the spirit from the pit of hell.When a spirit is giving you confidence in\\nsin and misinterpreting the word of God to sooth sin, that does not condemn\\nsin, that tells you to cover sin, that tells you not to condemn sin in your\\nministry, that tells you those sinful things you rejected before are not that\\nbad, such spirit is a familiar spirit from the pit of hell. GO BACK TO GODAre\\nyou having fading connection with Holy Spirit? You are far away from the Holy\\nSpirit? Or you have been manipulated by familiar spirit? It is not too late,\\nall you need to do is to repent, retrace your way back to Jesus and be\\nrenewed. Jesus is waiting for you where you left Him. He still loves you and\\nit is not over yet.

Two\\ndecades ago, McDowell began praying for revival to break out in his community,\\nand on May 22, 2016, the presence of God entered his church of Deeper\\nFellowship in Orlando and has yet to leave.The church has recorded over 300\\ndifferent healings and miracles to date.

People line up outside the church to attend Sunday\\nservices. The Cry is a powerful collection that puts to melody what God has\\nbeen doing in his church and with these people. During the live recording\\nmembers of Deeper Fellowship came on stage to share their testimony of healing\\n– a woman who was paralyzed and now walks, another woman who contracted a\\nlife-threatening amoeba and was miraculously and immediately healed.

And neither will\\nthey be the ones to Judge on the Judgement day!Matt.5.19 - Whoever therefore\\nBREAKS one of the least of these commandments, and TEACHES men so, shall be\\ncalled least in the kingdom of heaven; ...Far too many Church leaders and\\nfounders are particularly good at this: teaching their followers some\\n\"favourite\" laws or traditions, couple with their Self or Church-made\\ntraditions:Mark.7.7 - And in VAIN they WORSHIP Me, Teaching as doctrines the\\ncommandments OF MEN.\\'Mark.7.8 - For laying ASIDE the commandment of God, you\\nhold the TRADITION of men...Down below are some most commonly ignored or\\nDISOBEYED \"clear cut\" commandments of God\\'s Word:1. Taking Religious Titles,\\nand CALLING religious men names like \\'Father\\' and other common titles:In\\nMatt.23.8, Jesus, talking to his disciples -\\'Don\\'t ever let ANYONE call you\\n\\'Rabbi\\' for you have ONLY ONE teacher, and ALL OF YOU are on the SAME LEVEL as\\n\"brothers and sisters\".It\\'s VERY CLEAR that all titles like Pastor, Prophet,\\nReverend, Bishop, Pope, Etc are NOT acceptable.MOREOVER:Matt.23.9 - Do not\\n\"call\" ANYONE on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in\\nheaven.Matt.23.10 - And DO NOT be called teachers; for One is your Teacher,\\nthe Christ.Titles exalt Men above whom they\\'ve called to serve. It\\'s still\\ntrue even if most of us ignore or disobey it.2. Women should not TEACH nor\\ntake any position of AUTHORITY in the Church:1Cor.14.34 - Let your women KEEP\\nSILENT in the churches, for they are NOT PERMITTED to speak; but they are to\\nbe submissive, as the law also says.1Tim.2.12 - And I DO NOT PERMIT a woman to\\nTEACH or to have AUTHORITY OVER a man, but to be in silence.It\\'s clear women\\nought NOT to be Pastors, Prophets, and the likes in the Church. But they can\\nhowever prophesy and teach other women. Titus 2:4; Acts 2:17Remember, there\\nwas no woman among the 12 disciples of Jesus (the First Apostles).3. Give to\\nCaesar what is his before GIVING to God: The Bible also says OWE no man\\nANYTHING but to LOVE. Many of us want to be SUPER SPIRITUAL by giving to a\\nReligious Man or Church first because of VAIN \"prophetic\" promises. But the\\nBible says pay all DEBTS and FORGIVE others before bringing your gifts. Matt.\\n22:21; ROM. 13:84. i. You CANNOT SERVE God AND Mammon. Matt. 6:24ii. You\\nCANNOT serve God and Men. Gal. 1:10; 1 John 5:215. Deny yourself, take up the\\nCross daily and FOLLOW Jesus. Matt. 16:246. Give Cheerfully, not out of\\ncompulsion or by FORCE. 2 Cor. 9:7: This goes against all mandatory TITHING,\\nFirst fruits laws, Service, and all other COMPULSORY demands of Men.Romans\\n10:4 KJVFor Christ is THE END of the law for righteousness to \"every one\" that\\nbelieveth.7. Lay up yourself TREASURES in heaven, NOT here on Earth. Matt.\\n6:19-21AND:Take heed that No One (a Pastor/Prophet or just Anyone) DECEIVES\\nyou. Matt. 24:4, 24.8. Bless, don\\'t CURSE your enemies. Love them. Matt. 5:43\\n9. Do not seek Honour of Men. Do your good deeds in SECRET before God NOT Men.\\nMatt. 610. Judge not, judge yourself FIRST, and not be a hypocrite. Matt. 7.\\n11. Clean the inside of the Cup (the heart) First, and the outside will be\\nclean also. Matt. 23:2412. And so on in the Bible, especially the New\\ntestament.Obviously, this is NOT for everyone, but only for those of us who\\nhave got Ears to Hear. God\\'s POWER is sufficient for us to Obey if we WANT\\nto.We shouldn\\'t limit ourselves to some self-customized, MIXED denominational\\ndoctrines or traditions of GREAT Men and Churches. So as NOT miss God\\'s\\napproval and other SPIRITUAL blessings (not just earthly blessings).We really\\nneed to START taking OBEDIENCE to God\\'s Word seriously, NOT on profit-minded\\nMen or Churches.Jas.4.17 - Therefore, to him WHO KNOWS to do good and does not\\ndo it, to him it is SIN.John.14.15 - \"If you LOVE Me (Jesus), KEEP My\\ncommandments.May Lord Jesus bless you.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'To the unknown God ;Secularists promote secularism as a function of the\\ninformation they surrender their susceptibility to. Their worldview is a\\nreflection of materialism. There are two definitions of materialism. The first\\nis the tendency to acquire material possession while the other definition is\\nthe belief that whatever is not tangible, palpable and measurable by time and\\nspace is not real. In other words, if it cannot be subjected to empiricism,\\nit\\'s an illusion. They also believe that all problems under the sun has their\\nsolutions under the sunThat assertion sounds absolutely logical and\\nreasonable, but the implication it portends is the shutting down of the soul\\nfrom exercising one of it\\'s natural repertoire which is to explore beyond the\\nrealm of the earthly stratosphere in the search of solutions to life\\'s\\nconundrum.That school of thought also seem to amplify man\\'s\\ncorporeal(physical) plane of existence to the detriment of his\\nethereal(spiritual) plane of existence .Blaise Pascal said\" There is a reason\\nbeyond reasoning\". His assertion does not in the slightest form diminish or\\nrelegate reasoning , it however points in the direction of something beyond\\nreasoning.There are basically four positions of Christian Apologists. The\\nfirst is known as Christian Rationalism; The belief that reason is enough to\\ncompletely demonstrate the validity of the Christian faith(Raymond\\nLully)Followed by Christian Agnosticism; A complete distrust of reason. A\\nbelief that faith and reason don\\'t mix.(Blaise Pascal)The third is Logical\\nChristianity; The belief that one can begin with reason and move on to\\nfaith(Thomas Aquinas)Lastly, Autonomous Christianity; A belief that faith is\\nself - establishing and that it is not inconsistent with reason. Faith and\\nreason are not mutually exclusive. ( Cornelius Van Til)Of these four positions\\n, the third and fourth seem to slightly accommodate the position of\\nsecularists by giving a place to reason in man\\'s search for answers to life\\'s\\nquestions.Christianity is not against reason, but it\\'s above reasoning. To\\nargue that there is no more to life than what can be scientifically\\nestablished, is to be an intellectual ignoramus, proving ignorance with\\nintellect.False philosophy is like a blind man looking in a dark room for a\\nblack cat that isn\\'t there.False philosophy is that science of learning more\\nand more about less and less until you finally know everything about\\nnothing.Looking for what is not lost in a place that does not exist best\\ndescribes man\\'s several attempts to solve life\\'s puzzle outside of the divine\\n. A deliberate disregard of God is man\\'s greatest undoing.There is a God who\\nmade the heavens and the earth, though unknown to you, He knows everything\\nabout you.\\n\\n',\n",

How often does your great grandmother cross your mind?. You see!Our presence here on earth today, that presence that we make so much noise about and shed so many tears for, was preceded by countless generations before us and shall be followed by countless generations after us Jesus tarries.

Come to me, all who labor and are\\nheavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29.

Hate parents,\\nbrother, sister, children, spouse, in-laws, etc.2. Abandon all that you know,\\nbelieve, have, and all that you are3. Bear your own burden (not someone else\\'s\\ncross- not even your family\\'s or children\\'s) Matthew 10 vs 34-39\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n34. “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come\\nto bring peace. I came to bring trouble.[h] 35. I have come to make this\\nhappen: ‘A son will turn against his father. A daughter will turn against her\\nmother. A daughter-in-law will turn against her mother-in-law. 36. Even\\nmembers of your own family will be your enemies.’ 37. “Those who love their\\nfather or mother more than they love me are not worthy of me. And those who\\nlove their son or daughter more than they love me are not worthy of me. 38.\\nThose who will not accept the cross that is given to them when they follow me\\nare not worthy of me. 39.

You must be willing\\nto carry the cross that is given to you for following me. 25. Any of you who\\ntry to save the life you have will lose it. But you who give up your life for\\nme will find true life. 26. It is worth nothing for you to have the whole\\nworld if you yourself are lost. You could never pay enough to buy back your\\nlife. 27.

You cannot add any\\ntime to your life by worrying about it. 28. “And why do you worry about\\nclothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow.

If God makes what grows in the field so beautiful, what do you think he\\nwill do for you? It’s just grass—one day it’s alive, and the next day someone\\nthrows it into a fire.

Your faith is so small! 31. “Don’t worry and say,\\n‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32.\\nThat’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t\\nworry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. 33.\\nWhat you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do.\\nThen he will give you all these other things you need. 34.

But\\nanyone who does not love me does not obey my teaching. This teaching that you\\nhear is not really mine. It is from my Father who sent me.Go then, preach the\\ngood news about the Kingdom of Heaven.

And they arrived with fire and brimstone, their goal was to\\nconvert everyone from what they regarded as African paganism to\\nChristianity.The influence of Christianity is still very strong and visible in\\nIkot-Ekpene till date. However, since the native people already had their own\\nset of traditional beliefs, what later emerged over time in some areas of\\nIkot-Ekpene was a blend of Christianity and African traditional religions,\\nleading to a curious strand of syncretism that produced people like Edidem\\nBassey\\n\\n',\n",

I was driving and I had a friend also seated beside me\\non the front seat beside the driver. I wanted to stylishly convey my serious\\nintention to her parents, so I bought different kinds of fruits and wrapped\\nthem like engagement items and kept them inside the boot. Mind you I was\\nsupposed to attend a vigil on the eve of that day (Friday, 31st July), but I\\nchose not too, because I would be traveling the following morning. So, on\\ngetting to Alata area, before Deeper Life Camp (on the Ilorin-Ogbomosho\\nexpressway), I was not really overspeeding, but my car suddenly started\\nswerving. By that time, I had lost control of the wheels, so, the car was just\\nswerving on the road while on speed. My friend kept calling me and asking me\\nabout what was going on, and suddenly, the car hit one of these road dividers\\nmade of concrete and then summersaulted thrice and then faced the direction I\\nwas coming from (Ilorin). Now, the last thing I still remember was that when\\nthe car hit the road divider. I was GONE! It was as if there was a total\\nblackout. This was around 12pm. I remember seeing myself in a place where I\\nmet an old man. The old man asked me what I was doing there, I didn't utter a\\nword. So, he told me to go back to where I was coming from, that I had not\\neven done the work he gave me. At that time, I started hearing faintly the cry\\nof people, and then after about 3 to 4 hours, I opened my eyes and I saw about\\nfour Doctors and Nurses doing suitures on my head and ear. I had memory loss\\nand was just looking at everyone in the Theater. After some time, I asked\\nwhere I was and I was told Lautech Teaching Hospital in Ogbomoso. I then began\\nto ask them what had happened. They tried to ask me information about my\\nfamily but I remembered none until after about an hour again. I then saw my\\nfriend who by God's grace didn't sustain any serious injury. He then narrated\\nthe story: After my car (Honda bulldog) summersaulted thrice and stopped, the\\ncar bonnet flew to the other devide of the expressway. The car became a write\\noff and to bring me out was a task. While my friend was brought out through\\nthe side window, the people who rushed to the scene had to use Cutlass and\\nsome metals to further break the car into pieces and then brought out my dead\\nbody. People were already wailing when a Pastor driving in his church bus\\noffered to carry my body and my friend to the Teaching Hospital. As the man\\nwas driving, he was crying and praying that God should prove himself. That was\\non Saturday.On Monday, my elder sister was returning from Lagos and when she\\ngot to the spot where the accident occurred, the driver of the commercial bus\\nshe boarded was showing the passengers that that was where a serious accident\\noccurred on Saturday and a young guy died. Then, my sister told the guy that\\nthe guy came back to life, but the guy disbelieved. When it became an\\nargument, my elder sister called me and I spoke to her while in the commercial\\nbus. Could you believe that nothing happened to the fruits in the booth,\\nincluding the wine I bought? Funningly too, myself and the girl didn't\\neventually marry. WHAT CAN GOD NOT Do?

They told him about\\nthe recent happenings and the news of that same morning: some had said that He\\nwas alive, but they hadn’t seen Him.The stranger listened, then reproached\\nthem: “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe.” And he showed them that\\nwhat had happened had been prophesied in Scripture (i.e. the Old Testament\\nknown to the Jews) long before. The words of this unknown person bowled the\\ndisciples over completely.When they reached their destination they did not\\nwant to part from the one who had explained what they were experiencing from\\nthe scriptures they should have known.They begged him to remain with them in\\ntheir home, and he acepted their invitation “to stay with them”.

              "  'content': 'Apparently, many good or innocent people are being led astray by UNREPENTANT\\ngreedy Preachers and Church founders; hence, there is much need to keep\\nwarning and exhorting people, especially the \"spiritually needy\" ones and\\n\"new\" believers in Christ to take heed of COMMON things or TRICKS of these\\nFalse Prophets/Church founders. But to rather seek the REAL THINGS of Christ.\\nMoreover, rather than being Real Worshippers in Truth and in Spirit, lots of\\nbelievers (both the Old and New) are becoming more and MORE of \"addicts\" or\\nBOND SLAVES of Big Pastors and Profit-driven Churches of Men. Over the years,\\nthese False Men have trained people to believe the wrong or OPPOSITE side of\\nChrist (as Antichrists they are). One of these areas is about the Holy Spirit\\nand his manifestations. To some it\\'s about making NOISE, the higher the noise\\nthe higher the anointing, I suppose. It could be a NOISY Preaching, Prayer,\\nSongs and musical instrument. We might as well say they are getting a NOISY\\nSPIRIT, not the Holy Spirit.Another very common one among False Prophets is to\\ncause people to FALL DOWN. I think it should as well be called the FALLING\\nDOWN Spirit. Some of them seemingly use some MAGICAL POWERS that get people to\\nstart feeling dizzy or weak; to shake or even throw them off the ground. While\\nmany others just get people by the head and push them till they fall\\nbackwards. And of course, there are sometimes these \"spirit catchers\" behind\\nthese VICTIMS to support or keep them from getting hurt as they FALL under the\\n\"anointing\".It\\'s all a way of BRAINWASHING people, whether by magical power,\\npsychological or just whipping up people\\'s emotions by using a Slow to VERY\\nFAST Musical Session. And when people start rotating, shouting, clapping and\\ndancing ALL at the same time, NATURALLY their bodies get frustrated then they\\nstart to FALL DOWN, roll on the ground, shout, shake. This is particularly\\ncommon with women in these churches. I wonder if they get PAID to act those\\nemotional drama, or they\\'re innocent people who love those \"dramatic\\ndeceptions\".The major problem is not the falling down, shouting and the likes,\\nbut do they get a CHANGE of Life? NO! Anything sign of the fruit of the\\nSpirit? Probably ZERO!So what\\'s the use of all that FALLING and\\nSCREAMING?Beware! It\\'s ALL just \"Religious Rubbish\" of False Men.Jesus didn\\'t\\nPUSH people down, instead he RAISED people up. It would be wonderful if these\\npeople are made to fall down, and later get up to start living Holy and\\nfollowing Jesus. No, they go back home right in their usual Sins. And that\\'s\\nafter \"the Great Church-Magician\" must have collected his PAY (Offering and\\nother Random Charges) for his Great BRAINWASHING performance of getting people\\nto start falling down, shouting, shaking, weeping, roaring like a lion,\\nrolling on the ground: UNDER the roofs of DOING deliverance or claiming the\\nMOVE of the Holy Spirit.If it\\'s truly the Holy Spirit; then ultimately, people\\nwould become HOLY or Christlike in Reality, and also FORSAKE their OLD Sinful\\nWays of Sin and Worldliness.Besides, if someone is really EAGER TO Fall down,\\nhe/she doesn\\'t really need the wicked service of these False Prophets. He/she\\ncould just get \"properly\" DRUNK and fall down till he/she gets VERY TRIED of\\nfalling. It\\'s that simple.If we are truly seeking the TRUTH humbly, The Holy\\nSpirit will lead us into the true Righteousness and Holiness of Christ. Which\\nmeans we bear GOOD fruits:Gal.5.22 - But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,\\npeace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,Gal.5.23 - gentleness,\\nself-control. Against such THERE IS NO LAW.And what if all Churches or\\nfellowship gatherings we have around us are all False, or are obviously part\\nof those Churches born and bred by False Pastors and Founders?Of course, we\\ncan get into our rooms secretly on our own, pray and ASK GOD for the Holy\\nSpirit, provided we are Honest and TRULY HIS, living in obedience to his Words\\nas written in the New testament. Then we can trust him to bless us, and FILL\\nus with the Holy Spirit in order to DO HIS WILL. And the PROOF will be MAJORLY\\nthe POWER to live HOLY and SERVE Him, \"not\" to FALL DOWN, Yell, Roll on the\\nground and the likes.Acts.1.8 - But you shall RECEIVE POWER when the Holy\\nSpirit has COME UPON YOU; and you shall be WITNESSES to Me in Jerusalem, and\\nin all Judea and Samaria, and to the END OF THE EARTH.\" (NOT to fall down,\\nSCREAM and lose control; IN FACT, if it\\'s truly the Holy Spirit, you should\\nget MORE self-control to please God, NOT less).It\\'s time to get our eyes on\\nthe Reality of Jesus, not False Religious Men. And only seek to FOLLOW\\nChrist\\'s Example like Paul and other Apostles of Christ. Not these Money and\\nHonour seeking False Religious Men, and their FALSE Spirits in their False\\nChurches.May the Lord Jesus bless you.\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Over the week, Bishop David Oyedepo sparked controversy on social media after\\nhe said that tweeted about tithing. This led many people like Daddy Freeze and\\nother Nigerians to react by giving their own opinion on what tithing\\nis.Oyedepo had tweeted:Tithing is an inescapable covenant obligation.\\nProsperity not just wealth is impossible without tithing, because when you\\'re\\nnot paying your tithe, you\\'re under a financial curse.What Oyedepo said is\\ntotally right (even though I don\\'t like him and know he\\'s fake). It is only\\napplicable to people who are saved and children of God. No fake Christians or\\nunbelievers.Yes, tithing is a covenant. Also, you can\\'t proper and acquire\\nwealth without tithing, that\\'s if you are a child of God and saved. If you are\\nnot a child of God, then the message is not for you. You can go acquire wealth\\nand prosperity through dubious and corrupt means; people do, Hushpuppi did.Are\\nyou under a financial curse when you don\\'t pay your tithe? Yes, if you are a\\nchild of God. Why is that so? Because you are robbing God. You are spending\\nwhat belongs to him which exposes you to the devourer.Now, let\\'s examine how\\nDaddy Freeze responded to Oyedepo\\'s tweet.Daddy Freeze tweeted: Utter\\nnonsense!Are you one percent as prosperous or as wealthy as Jeff Bezos, Bill\\nGates and Warren Buffet who dont tithe? I personally find this unscriptural\\nstatement manipulative and cruel. Christ didnt collect tithe neither did the\\ndisciples, yet no one was cursed!It is stupid comparing the unbelievers to\\nChristians. Will all know how these billionaires came about their wealth. Even\\nat that, none of them have been able to attain as much as King Solomon who\\ntithed. Kindly note that it is foolish to tithe in the name of wanting to be\\nwealthy and prosperous. Tithing is giving to God what belongs to him. He only\\nblesses you for your obedience and does more by keeping you away from harm\\'s\\nway i.e the devourer. God has already assured you of prosperity, but not\\ntithing out of it cannot send you back to being poor.But how come the wicked\\npeople are wealthier than Christians? Don\\'t be envious of them. Such mindset\\nreminds me of Asaph in the book of Psalms. Read how he became envious of the\\nwicked, their riches and the peace they enjoyed.Psalm 73:3E For I was envious\\nat the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.4 For there are no\\nbands in their death: but their strength is firm.5 They are not in trouble as\\nother men; neither are they plagued like other men.6 Therefore pride\\ncompasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.7 Their\\neyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.8 They are\\ncorrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.9 They\\nset their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the\\nearth.He went on to lamented that he was just living a clean life in vain.\\nIsn\\'t that the same way youths of today say \"school na scam\" because internet\\nfraudsters are now celebrated? He lamented until he saw what their end will\\nbe. Isn\\'t that similar to how Hushpuppi was celebrated to the point that\\nrighteous and hard-working guys almost looked stupid. But look at his end\\ntoday.Psalm 73:12-1912 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the\\nworld; they increase in riches.13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and\\nwashed my hands in innocency.14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and\\nchastened every morning.15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should\\noffend against the generation of thy children.16 When I thought to know this,\\nit was too painful for me;17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then\\nunderstood I their end.18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou\\ncastedst them down into destruction.19 How are they brought into desolation,\\nas in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.Let\\'s address one more\\nthing Daddy Freeze said which is wrong.He said,Christ didnt collect tithe\\nneither did the disciples, yet no one was cursedWho told him Jesus Christ\\ndidn\\'t collect tithe? Perhaps, he\\'s expecting to see a verse clearly stating\\nsuch. Since there is no clear statement in that in the Bible, we can as well\\nconclude that Jesus never took his bath or go to the toilet since there is no\\nverse on that as well. Saying Jesus didn\\'t collect tithe is the same as saying\\nhe\\'s a liar when he said:John 16:15 KJV15 All things that the Father hath are\\nmine: Everything that belongs to God also belongs to Jesus including tithe.\\nWhile he was on Earth, the tithe being paid at the temple belonged to him same\\nway it belonged to him while he was in heaven and even now. Nowhere did he\\nabolish tithing. He had the opportunity twice to do so but instead he upheld\\nit.So, what Oyedepo said is totally right and only meant for saved Christians,\\nnot for unbelievers. Even false high priest Caiaphas once said something right\\nwhen he said Jesus should die for the sins of the whole world.John 11:50Nor\\nconsider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people,\\nand that the whole nation perish not.The below threads will answer your\\nquestions on tithing.https://www.nairaland.com/4906753/daddy-freeze-liar-\\ntithing-veryhttps://www.nairaland.com/5469455/giving-tithe-church-needy-\\nwhathttps://www.nairaland.com/4938431/it-not-law-moses-god\\n\\n',\n",

Let God reign in your life, let him rule over you.\\nIf God is not ruling over you then you cannot be priest, prophet and king.\\nBeing a priest requires sacrificing yourself, laying yourself upon the altar\\nas a living sacrifice. \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of\\nGod, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto\\nGod, which is your reasonable service.\" (Rom 12:1).No flesh can do this. The\\nflesh is designed with the law of survival and self-preservation. It wants to\\nsurvive no matter what, it would not easily accept death. It would take God\\'s\\ngovernment apprehending you in order to bring you to the altar. If God\\'s\\ngovernment have not apprehend you, if it is not ruling over your flesh, then\\nit cannot truly rule through you. So the first job of an ecclesia is to bring\\ntheir members under God\\'s government, so that they would become fit as a\\nvessel through which God would manifest his government on earth. Now, from all\\nI have been saying about the ecclesia; how they must manifest God\\'s government\\nnot just in their locality, but also in their workplace and everywhere they\\nfind themselves. This means that the ecclesia have a lot to conquer under\\nGod\\'s government, they cannot waste so much time still trying to conquer their\\nmembers. The assignment is very big, and we cannot get stucked at stage one.\\nThis means the ecclesia have to grow speedingly, for the journey is far.\\nHence, the ecclesia must be organized for speedy spiritual growth. Yes, there\\nis a way that a people can be organized that would lead to speedy growth. Let\\nme quickly state that ecclesia is different from church. Members of ecclesia\\ncan go to church, they should sit under the ministry of gifted men so that\\nthey can be edified and grow. Ecclesia meetings can be held every Sunday after\\nchurch, it could be in the afternoon or evening. There is an ecclesia meeting\\nI attended here in Lagos, it is holds in the afternoon on Sunday. So the\\necclesia members are encouraged to go to church, but it must be a church that\\ntruly edify and equip you. This is because, during the ecclesia meeting you\\nwould be asked to edify the whole body with what you have gotten from church.\\nThe ecclesia members do not pledge allegiance to any church or denomination.\\nYou cannot be foolishly going to one church every Sunday when you know you are\\nnot being edified there. You are not only damaging your spiritual life, you\\nare damaging the spiritual life of the whole ecclesia. They all want to be\\nedified by you, and if you are not getting anything from the church you go\\nthen find somewhere else where you can get something that would edify the\\ngroup. Many people go to certain churches just because of their loyalty to the\\ndenomination or the G.O. No, the ecclesia members pledge their allegiance to\\nonly Christ, they are after Christ, they want to draw from the riches of\\nChrist and be filled with Christ. So they go anywhere the Spirit of Christ is\\nleading them to, anywhere they know they will draw something out of Christ.\\nThere is a church I know that sometimes it teaches good substance, but\\nsometimes it teaches rubbish. I am careful to find out the topic before\\nstaying for the service. If I perceive the topic is not something that would\\nedify me, I might just leave immediately, and find another church to go or\\nsomething. I need to be edified. There is no time to waste, you can\\'t be\\ndragging your feet, the assignment is huge. So our priority is to grow\\nspeedingly. Apart from sitting under edifying and equipping ministry, the\\necclesia meeting is organized to foster speedy spiritual growth. There is a\\nkind of structure and design that when put in place the members would be\\ngrowing so fast. \"Two people are better off than one, for they can help each\\nother succeed. If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But\\nsomeone who falls alone is in real trouble. Likewise, two people lying close\\ntogether can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? A person\\nstanding alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back\\nand conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily\\nbroken.\" (Ecc 4:9-12).Church encourages an individualistic Christianity. But\\nin ecclesia your spiritual growth is not person oh, it is a community\\nbusiness. If you are not growing it will affect the whole body, that is why\\nyour spiritual growth is the business of the whole community. We are doing it\\ntogether so that if you are falling, someone can easily pick you up. But if\\nyour spiritual life is so secretive and so personal, how would others know to\\nhelp you. This is why in the ecclesia meeting you open up yourself and share\\neverything. You share your current situation in your walk with God, and what\\nyou are doing to improve it.In the ecclesia we support one another with love.\\nWe understand that everyone have their own weaknesses, and we are there to\\nstrengthen each other, to help each other overcome and live the victorious\\nChristian life. Ecclesia is design to organize the members to actively explore\\nthe unsearchable riches of Christ, like gold miners digging for gold. When one\\nperson hit gold he brings it out and shares it with the rest so they become\\nrich. When another one of them hit gold he/she brings it out and share with\\nthe rest, then they all become richer, and another finds gold through his hard\\ndigging, brings it out and share with the group. Little by little they all are\\nbecoming richer and richer with Christ until they become completely filled\\nwith all the fullness of Christ. Church is design to have majority of the\\npeople sit passively and watch a small group of people perform on the altar.\\nPassivity is not the way of growth. You need to actively engage Christ. You\\nneed to be given a platform to share Christ, for that is the way of growth.\\nChrist is like a river that must be allowed to flow. The more you share, the\\nmore you grow. But if you do not share, it will die inside of you and your\\ngrowth will be stunted. This is why ecclesia is there to give you that\\nplatform to share with fellow believers and edify each other. The ecclesia\\ngoal is to make sure the members are truly growing, and as such a structure\\nmust be set up to foster spiritual growth. The apostle is the one to design\\nthis structure. The work of the apostle is to lay the foundation, so that the\\nbody of Christ can fulfill God\\'s eternal plan. So the ecclesia would need the\\napostles or any other person who have learn from the apostles on how to lay\\ndown this structure. Without this structure the ecclesia would be struggling.\\nCarnality will be lashing out unrestrained, ruining the fellowship. The\\necclesia would even dissolve if this structure is not lay down. They will just\\nfight each other and scatter everything, each person going his own way.\\nIntimacy is not an easy thing, that is why church avoid it. Opening up\\nyourself, exposing your life to another is not an easy thing. Practicing the\\necclesia is not easy, and if it is not done carefully, if the proper structure\\nis not laid down, everything might turn out very ugly and no one would want to\\nstay.An apostle would teach you how to organize yourself, how to do your\\nmeetings, how to deal with carnality and eradicate it from their midst, how to\\nencourage and motivate each other to grow speedingly, how to come under the\\ngovernment of God, how to grow in corporately ascension into the court of\\nheaven, how to grow in exercising the government of God. Apart from the\\napostle laying the foundation, you will also need other ministers such as the\\nteachers and prophets. In the first century, the ecclesia they practiced was\\nopen to other ministries. A teacher can come in to equip the saints and go his\\nway. A prophet could also come and equip them in the way the Lord has trained\\nhim to, and then go his way.\"When one of you says, “I am a follower of Paul,”\\nand another says, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting just like people of\\nthe world? After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God’s servants\\nthrough whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave\\nus. I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God\\nwho made it grow.\" (1Cor 3:4-6).The minister does not matter, what matters is\\nthat the people grow. Any ministry can come, introduce themselves to the\\necclesia, tell them how they can make their ecclesia more effective. And if\\nthe ecclesia accept the ministry he could come in and equip them. When he is\\ndone he would go his way. That is ecclesia life, ministers come in and out,\\nbut the ecclesia must not pledge allegiance to any minister. They are to focus\\nonly on growing. Yes, grow into the government of God, let his government\\nconsume you completely until you become a living embodiment of God\\'s\\ngovernment on earth.\\n\\n',\n",

God only begins where man ends. SCRIPTURE:\\nAnd the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he\\ntook one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib,\\nwhich the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto\\nthe man. Genesis 2:21-22. THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: God only begins where man ends.\\nThe Scriptures make it clear that we serve the God of new beginnings (Isa.\\n43:18-19). In Scriptures, examples abound in many situations and in the lives\\nof different people where God proved Himself as the God of new beginnings\\n(Gen. 1:1-3, Judg. 16:22, Ezekiel 37:1-10, Luke 5:1-6, John 2:1-11, Job\\n42:10-12). He has not changed and He will not change (Mal.3:6). What He did\\nbefore, He is ready to do again. And in this season, He will give you a new\\nbeginning regardless of any agenda of the enemy against your life. Now, it is\\nimportant to note that every scriptural provision attracts scriptural\\nconditions. There are keys to experiencing a new beginning with God. Today, we\\nshall be looking at one key to experiencing a new beginning with God: One of\\nthe keys is coming to the end of yourself. To experience a new beginning with\\nGod, you must come to the end of yourself. God only begins where man ends. God\\nis not at work where man's energy is doing what God is meant to do. The end\\nwith man is the beginning with God. For instance, before God could make Eve\\nfor Adam, He (God) had to put Adam to sleep (Gen. 2:21-22). It was when Adam\\nslept that God worked. It was when Adam came to the end of himself that he\\nexperienced a new beginning with God. It was when Adam submitted himself to\\nGod that he saw God’s activity. Beloved, if you want His activity, you must\\nsubmit your own activity. You must come to the end of your connections,\\neducation, potentials, etc. before you can experience a new beginning with\\nGod. Furthermore, it was when the earth was shapeless and empty that the\\nSpirit of God began to move upon the face of the waters (Genesis 1:2). God was\\nnot contesting with anybody or anything on the earth, so He could work freely\\nand create the earth. In the same manner, you must come to the point where you\\nsurrender yourself, your effort, energy, anointing, talents and gifting to\\nGod, and then you are at the end of yourself. You must submit anything you can\\nboast of before God. Your boast must only be in the Lord (Psalm 34:2). This is\\nbecause God can never work in the atmosphere of arrogance, ostentation, and\\nhaughtiness. So, drop your shoulders, and come to the end of yourself. This is\\na key to experiencing a new beginning with God. Remember this: God only begins\\nwhere man ends.

PRAYER: Father, I receive the grace to come to the end of myself so\\nI can experience a new beginning with You, Lord in Jesus’ Name. FOR FURTHER\\nUNDERSTANDING, GET THIS MESSAGE: THE GOD OF NEW BEGINNING. QUOTE: And God is\\nsaying, ‘As long as that pride is there; as long as that arrogance is there;\\nas long as that raising of the shoulders is there, I cannot use you.” culled\\nfrom “THOU ART MY BATTLE AXE” by Dr Paul Enenche. DAILY BIBLE READING:\\nProverbs 16-18. AMAZING FACT: Being a Christian, as well as being involved in\\nchurch-related activities improves your health. A number of studies support\\nthe fact that Christianity has a positive effect on the mental health of its\\npractitioners. For example, researchers from the Erasmus Medical Centre and\\nthe London School of Economics and Political Science found that older\\nEuropeans are mentally better off attending church than participating in\\nsports, charity work and political and community activities.

              "  'content': 'Racism Is Incompatible With ChristianityBy Brian Chilton -September 5,\\n2017This KKK member calls himself a \"misunderstood Christian.\"This past\\nSaturday, I returned home from our church’s annual Vacation Bible School. The\\ntopic for this year’s VBS was on putting on the full armour of God. When I sat\\ndown in my office chair, I turned on my laptop to check the website and look\\nover a few final details for Sunday’s message. As I perused my social media\\naccount, one of the headlines told of a tragedy that had occurred in\\nCharlottesville, Virginia.White supremacist groups, Neo-Nazis, among others\\ngathered in the streets of Charlottesville to espouse their radical ideas.\\nAmidst their demonstrations, counter-protestors made their voices heard.\\nEventually, the scene turned violent as a James Alex James, Jr., 20, of\\nMaumee, Ohio plowed his car into the counter-protestors, killing Heather\\nHeyer, 32, of Charlottesville and injuring many others.“WE DON’T HATE PEOPLE\\nBECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. I MEAN, WE’RE A CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION,” – FRANK\\nANCONA, KKK IMPERIAL WIZARDAs a pastor, a theologian, and most importantly a\\nChristian, I am appalled by the racist ideologies plaguing our society. Racism\\nexhibited by any person of any race is incompatible with the Christian\\nworldview for the following reasons.Racism is incompatible with Jesus’s\\nexample. Jesus ministered to many people from different walks of life. While\\nhe challenged individuals in different ways, he never turned anyone away.[1]\\nAs Jesus said, “Everyone the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who\\ncomes to me I will never cast out” (John 6:37).[2]Racism is incompatible with\\nJesus’s teachings.The Parable of the Good Samaritan was a radical story (Luke\\n10:25-37). In Jesus’s parable, the protagonist was a Samaritan. The nature of\\nthe story is lost until one realises that Samaritans were hated by the Jews\\nbecause they were a mixed race. Jesus teaches in this story, among many of his\\nother messages, that the believer is to love his or her neighbour. Who is\\none’s neighbour? The parable shows that a person’s neighbour is each person\\nencountered.Racism is incompatible with God’s nature.Throughout Scripture, it\\nis noted that God is love {1 John 4:8}. In addition, God is shown to impartial\\nto individuals regardless of race (Deut. 10:17; Lk. 20:21; Acts 10:34; Rom.\\n2:11). As a loving and impartial God, no one could justify that following God\\nallows one to be racially motivated, an act that is unloving and\\npartial.Racism is incompatible with the Gospel’s mission.Jesus did not tell\\nHis disciples to go to only one race. Rather, they were to begin with their\\ncurrent location and then move towards the uttermost parts of the world {Acts\\n1:8}. Jesus told the disciples to go and “make disciples of all nations,\\nbaptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy\\nSpirit” (Matt. 28:19).Racism is incompatible with heaven’s populace.In John’s\\nvision of heaven, he sees a “vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people,\\nand language, which no one could number, standing before the throne and before\\nthe Lamb” (Rev. 7:9). The believer will associate with fellow Christians from\\nall walks of life, from every race, and from every language in heaven. It\\nseems to me that we had better learn how to get along with fellow believers\\nfrom all walks of life. Because in heaven, we’ll be spending a long time\\ntogether!Racism is incompatible with the Christian faith. Let us shine God’s\\nlove and grace to every person we encounter whether they look like us or not.\\nLet us impartially love others for the glory of God and of His\\nMessiah.https://reasonsforjesus.com/racism-is-incompatible-with-christianity/\\n\\n',\n",

Later, Jesus talked to the people again. He said, “I am the light of the\\nworld. Whoever follows me will never live in darkness. They will have the\\nlight that gives life.” 13. But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “When you talk\\nabout yourself, you are the only one to say that these things are true. So we\\ncannot accept what you say.” 14. Jesus answered, “Yes, I am saying these\\nthings about myself. But people can believe what I say, because I know where I\\ncame from. And I know where I am going. But you don’t know where I came from\\nor where I am going. 15. You judge me the way people judge other people. I\\ndon’t judge anyone. 16.

Your own law says\\nthat when two witnesses say the same thing, you must accept what they say. 18.\\nI am one of the witnesses who speaks about myself. And the Father who sent me\\nis my other witness.” 19. The people asked, “Where is your father?” Jesus\\nanswered, “You don’t know me or my Father. But if you knew me, you would know\\nmy Father too.” 20. Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the\\nTemple area, near the room where the Temple offerings were kept.

Be prepared to abandon parents, brother, sister, children, spouse,\\nin-laws, e.t.c. 2. Abandon all that you know/believe, have, and all that you\\nare 3.

You cannot add any\\ntime to your life by worrying about it. 28. “And why do you worry about\\nclothes? Look at the wildflowers in the field. See how they grow.

Your faith is so small! 31. “Don’t worry and say,\\n‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’ 32.\\nThat’s what those people who don’t know God are always thinking about. Don’t\\nworry, because your Father in heaven knows that you need all these things. 33.\\nWhat you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what he wants you to do.\\nThen he will give you all these other things you need. 34.

              "  'content': 'What did the Bible really say about Tithes?⚠️ May be too long, kindly read\\nthrough. Thank youTo start with, I will like to say, in this write up, you\\'ll\\nsee what Jesus said about tithes. Thank you.Tithe is seen as one-tenth of your\\nincome and in churches, we have seen people come up with mathematics of paying\\ntithes, such as remove your expenses and pay with your profit.Some will say,\\nadd up all your income and this and that.They call it, how to adequately\\ncalculate your tithes.Many believers didn\\'t even bother to ask for what the\\nBible said. We just believe that we should pay tithe because \"as it was in the\\nbeginning, so is it now, and so shall it be forever\". Really?While some of us\\nhave the notion of not paying because, \"pastors use our money for \"lavishing\",\\nreally?Let me say first, that what makes you Christians and even non-\\nChristians so particular about this issue of tithe is \"inability to let go of\\nwhat we have\" which I will term as \"greed\".But you may not see it that way\\nbecause it\\'s yours, but first to ask, is it yours really?Let\\'s look at what we\\nhave in the Bible.Mal.3.8 - \"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But\\nyou say, \"In what way have we robbed You?\\' In tithes and offerings.Mal.3.9 -\\nYou are cursed with a curse, For you have robbed Me, Even this whole\\nnation.Mal.3.10 - Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, That there may be\\nfood in My house, And try Me now in this,\" Says the LORD of hosts, \"If I will\\nnot open for you the windows of heaven And pour out for you such blessing That\\nthere will not be room enough to receive it.This scripture is mainly used by\\nus to buttress our points on tithing and to mean, if you don\\'t pay tithe, as\\nthat Scripture said, you\\'re under a curse for robbing God.Shall we look into\\nthis scripture and bring out some things?1. God was speaking to Israel and not\\nto the entire world. Israel represents the chosen people and for real, how\\nwill you be a chosen of the Lord and not care about His house? (We will still\\nlook at what the new testament said)2. It wasn\\'t even seen as been compulsory,\\nrather an admonition if you seek to enter that covenant.3. It wasn\\'t so that\\nyou can say you\\'ve paid tithe, but rather to contribute your own quota to the\\ndevelopment of the house of God. Is that too big to do?Let\\'s check another\\nscripture.Heb.7.1 - For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most\\nHigh God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and\\nblessed him, Heb.7.2 - to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first\\nbeing translated \"king of righteousness,\" and then also king of Salem, meaning\\n\"king of peace,\"Heb.7.3 - without father, without mother, without genealogy,\\nhaving neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of\\nGod, remains a priest continually.This is new testament account of how Abraham\\npaid tithe to Melchizedek, king of peace, who is a similitude of the son of\\nGod, who was to come.Abraham paid this tithe before the law, and so we can\\nrule out that saying that, \"tithe is under the law\".Tithing has been before\\nthe law, during the law, even after the law (even much more after the law).So\\nif Abraham, who by faith, paid tithe to Melchizedek (the image of the son of\\nGod to come), does that mean those of us who are by faith and living by faith,\\naren\\'t we supposed to do same?Don\\'t forget that apart from Abraham giving one-\\ntenth, he as well gave all of himself to God.Now we can now examine, quickly\\nwhat Jesus/New testament said about tithe and giving in general.Matt.23.23 -\\n\"How terrible it will be for you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees.\\nHypocrites! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest part of your income,\\nbut you ignore the important things of the law--justice, mercy, and faith. You\\nshould tithe, yes, but you should not leave undone the more important things.\\n(NLT).That was the Lord Jesus saying, tithing without taking other things into\\nconsideration is as evil as evil itself. You can see Jesus saying \"Woe!\"So how\\nbad is it to tithe when you don\\'t even know God? Makes any difference? So you\\ntithe a stolen funds (that is without mercy and justice) and you think you\\'re\\ncovered?In fact, the sacrifice of a wicked man is an abomination unto\\nGod!Acts.2.44 - Now all who believed were together, and had all things in\\ncommon,Acts.2.45 - and sold their possessions and goods, and divided them\\namong all, as anyone had need.This is new testament, giving all you have for\\nyour God.Is it about tithe? Yes pay tithe, but much more Jesus said, faith\\nwhich enables you to live the crucified life.I believe we can ask ourselves\\nsome questions.Did the early church speak so much of tithe? No.Did Jesus\\nspecifically preach tithe no?We found Paul saying, \"I know how to abase and\\nhow to abound\"Even the Lord Jesus fed the 5,000 without asking them to\\ncontribute a dime. So it teaches me, God wasn\\'t asking for our tithe, but all\\nof us!2Cor.5.14 - For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus:\\nthat if One died for all, then all died;2Cor.5.15 - and He died for all, that\\nthose who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for\\nthem and rose again.This is the Bible saying, at this point, you\\'re not living\\nfor yourself anymore, but for Him, if of a truth, you have met Him.It then\\ntells me that,A Christian who has truly met the Lord Jesus would not mind to\\ngive all, not to talk of a tenth.A Christian who has truly met the Lord, will\\nnot even compel people to pay tithe, or give, for the work isn\\'t for him but\\nfor the Lord.To conclude, tithing is scriptural, before Moses (by faith), it\\nexisted. During Moses (the law) it existed. In the Lord Jesus (by faith in\\nJesus) it as well exists.So give all of yourself to God. That is His request,\\nnot just your tithe.Mark.12.41 - Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw\\nhow the people put money into the treasury. And many who were rich put in\\nmuch.Mark.12.42 - Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make\\na quadrans.Mark.12.43 - So He called His disciples to Himself and said to\\nthem, \"Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all\\nthose who have given to the treasury.Till today, He still sits over the\\ntreasury and knows why and what you give to His house.There are in fact\\nseveral scriptures that suggest to us from Genesis to revelation, the biblical\\nposition of paying tithes. You can as well dig into your bible and find out\\nmore.God bless you.Men on Fire\\n\\n',\n",

He said many thing ranging to how men are not cared\\nfor from puberty when they are growing up to how they lack leadership skills.\\nBut right in the middle of it in the second verse is an issue that has caused\\ndebate, he faulted Adam in Eve\\'s sin.

If Eve was created after him wasn\\'t he in\\ncharge of leading and protecting her both physically and mentally?The entire\\nsecond verse of the song was basically saying men are responsible for a lot of\\nthe misinformation young girls and boys get from the media but when the girl\\ngoes bad we complain.The question that bugs me is this are we really\\nresponsible for how women think?

P.G Wodehouse humorously used the phrase, “lilies of the\\nfleld” to refer to the idle rich who do not labour. The keyword here is IDLE,\\nIndeed, the rich are not idle, but there is a level you get to in life where\\nWORRY, SWEATING STRUGGLING and ANXIETY are minimal in your life! That phase of\\nlife is called the “IDLE PHASE” It is a phase likened to the story of the\\nFLOWERS (LILIES) of the earth! They do not groan, but they GLOW! They do not\\nsweat but they SHINE! They do not WORRY, but they are WINNERS in beauty! Have\\nyou ever seen a group of trees or flowery plants in spring? Oh! Goodness! I\\nremember the DUBAI MIRACLE GARDEN! When you see the BEAUTY and BLOSSOM of\\nFLOWERS, you will know indeed, that EVEN SOLOMON in all his man-made glory was\\nnot up to these FLOWERY PLANTS in beauty! Success is not by struggle or hustle\\nwithout direction! Today’s scripture Verse 28 says: “And why take ye thought\\nfor raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow they toil not,\\nneither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his\\nglory was not arrayed like one of these.”The LORD was pointing out that the\\nlilies of the field do not labour or produce anything, yet they are dressed\\nmore than the most glamorous palaces of King Solomon. WHO DRESSES THEM? Do you\\nknow that the glory of Solomon is still considered to be the most grandiose in\\nthe whole of the Middle East and in the Jewish kingdom? Yes! The lilies of the\\nfield are brilliant and they have a very gorgeous appearance! And they are\\nmore colourful than the splendour of Solomon’s palace. Listen: THE GOD WHO\\nDRESSES and decorates THE LILIES, will DRESS YOU and COVER YOU UP from SHAME\\nand FAILURE! Solomon was so glorious/glamorous that the QUEEN OF SHEBA fainted\\nat seeing his glory! The LORD says to you: “What I shall do in you and through\\nyou will cause men to quake and faint in heart!Determine to worry less! Smile\\nMore! Listen carefully! Take responsibilities! Don’t worry about tomorrow!\\nAccept what you can’t change! Embrace the lessons of every event in your life!\\nResıst worry over who to marry, what to wear, eat, live in your country or\\nabroad, fear of death, etc. Love your life because worrying is a waste of\\ntime! Good and bad things will happen in life. You just have to keep living\\nand not be stressed over what you cannot control. Our anxieties do not come\\nfrom thinking about the future but from wanting to control it.So despite the\\nfact that the lilies (FLOWERY PLANTS) do not struggle or know tomorrow, they\\njust BLOSSOM! From this day, in this 2nd half of the year, even your progress\\nwill shock you because the ONE inside of you is the Creator of the LILIES and\\nthe God of SOLOMON! Trust Him! Shame will never be your name nor, “your last\\nbus-stop.” Pray now! 14-DAY WORLDWIDE FAST-9 DAYS TO GO!Prepare for the annual\\nWORLDWIDE ODM 14-day fasting programme.

No matter how educated or successful you are, your\\nhusband is your head and you must regard him as such at all times. It is a\\nterrible thing for the husband to feel that his wife is his head. Many men are\\nmisbehaving in their marriage because they want to establish that they are the\\nhead of their wives.“Also, my wife is my number one fan. She wrote in the book\\nMathematics of marriage- which we coauthored, that as my help meet she knows\\nshe cannot help me without my instructions, so when they come, her response is\\n‘Yes sir’.“Busy as she is, she still cooks my meals and serve me herself. Many\\nyoung ladies these days leave everything to the house help. My wife still\\ntrims my nails for me.”Although the message was well-received by many of\\nAdeboye’s followers, several feminists on social media called out the cleric\\nfor promoting patriarchy and male chauvinism.On Twitter, Adeboye was trending\\nat number one on Tuesday amid the raging controversy.@_Toseen_ tweeted, “If\\nmarriage is going to be how Baba Adeboye described it, then f**k it. I\\ncannot.”@benxta_ also tweeted, “I can’t believe Adeboye really sat down and\\nfound a way to make his wife’s birthday about himself and his power over her.\\nA simple ‘happy birthday my love’ will do next time please.”@ehssayy stated,\\n“No one turned it into a gender war. It’s your wife’s birthday and yes I know\\nthe woman has chosen her path in marriage but if that’s how you praise someone\\nyou’re in love with and is supposed to be your wife then it’s just sad.”“The\\ndefinition of wife material in our country is a slavery woman. Acts like doll\\nbaby you’re a good woman,” @prettyb26275331 tweeted.However, thousands of\\nTweeps came out in support of Adeboye.Social media influencer, Japheth\\nOmojuwa, said it was unfortunate that some youths could attack Adeboye who is\\na respected cleric.A tweep, Dipo Awojide, wrote, “Listen to Pastor Adeboye\\nwhen he speaks. The man is old, wise and experienced. You might not agree with\\neverything he says, but his messages are usually filed with wisdom for those\\nwho pay attention.”@Tifeofficial tweeted, “Normally, women are supposed to be\\nsubmissive to their husbands. Pastor Adeboye was just stating facts and\\nappreciating his wife for being submissive, so it’s stupid to insult him, when\\nhe was just being right. Plus: if he was a terrible husband, submission would\\nhave been hard for her.”Source : https://punchng.com/feminists-at-war-with-\\nadeboye-over-birthday-message-to-wife/\\n\\n',\n",

And the people answered him not a word. 1\\nKings 18:21THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: You are not a dedicated child of God if you\\ncannot choose God above anything or anyone else.Yesterday, we saw that one way\\nto be dedicated to God is pursuing Him wholeheartedly. Dedication to God\\nimplies pursuing God with a united heart and not a divided heart. It is having\\nonly one purpose and focus in following God.However, there are many people\\nwhose hearts are divided in their attempt to pursue God. There are people\\nwhose hearts are divided in what they want out of life. Let me give you some\\nexamples: I heard that in some places, if there is a football match, for\\nexample, the Super Eagles of Nigeria playing a match against the national\\nfootball team of Argentina or a club like Arsenal playing against Chelsea and\\nthe time of the match clashes with church service time, some people would go\\nto watch the match instead of going to church. I also heard that in some\\nplaces, television would even be brought to the church so that the people can\\nwatch the match if the match time is clashing with church service time. This\\nis an error! This is a manifestation of a divided heart.For other people, it\\nis a particular movie they cannot sacrifice for church service. They must have\\nwatched up to twelve parts or episodes of the movie and the time to watch the\\nthirteenth episode is clashing with church service time; they would sacrifice\\nchurch service for the movie. That is not correct! It is an indication of a\\ndivided heart.Beloved, do not do yourself such injustice. You are not a\\ndedicated child of God if you cannot choose God above anything or anyone else.\\nYou are not a dedicated child of God if you cannot sacrifice even what you\\nlove for the sake of your relationship with God. If you have done anything\\nbefore this time at the expense of your relationship with God, repent today.\\nMake up your mind not to do that again, and choose God above everything and\\neveryone else in life.Remember this: You are not a dedicated child of God if\\nyou cannot choose God above anything or anyone else.

Two years ago a social media friend asked me to invest in a\\nbusiness that he was coordinating, he told me my investment was going to pay\\noff. At first, I didn't want to engage into it but by his persuasion and\\nconviction, I decided to give it a try because I trusted him.I discovered the\\nbusiness was a scam after I have invested in it.The experience was not funny\\nas it hurt me so bad that I had to withdraw from social media for a period of\\ntime, in the period of my absent on social media, it dawned on me that I have\\nso much to gain on social media than what I have lost.I made a choice to keep\\nmoving and keep trusting people but more carefully this time around.This goes\\nwith whatever you have been cheated on with, when you allow it to get over you\\nit makes you stagnant in life.Before you stop trusting, calculate the\\nadvantages and the disadvantages and see who is losing in the game.Not\\ntrusting again is like choosing not to progress in life.Whatever area you have\\nbeen cheated on, you need to let go and move on.A farmer never stops planting\\neven if the previous harvest was bad. They have hope that the soil will\\nproduce a great harvest someday.It could be that your spouse is cheating on\\nyou, walking out of the relationship is not a good option but letting go and\\ntrusting again mostly when the person has repented is the best\\nchoice.Rebuilding trust means to renew your mind, let go of the past and\\nforgive whoever has hurt you.Not all snakes were meant to bite, being beaten\\nby a snake doesn't mean every snake you see in the bush has come to bite\\nyou.Click on the link below for more.https://www.getbackfaith.com/2020/05/how-\\nto-rebuild-trust-after-you-have.html\\n\\n\",\n",

              "  'content': 'A The Allegory in The Garden of Eden Account of the Fall of Man When Christ\\nsaid “except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have\\nno life in you” (John 6:53), He did not mean His literal body. Most people\\nwill accept this as true. The Son of God was obviously not advocating Papua\\nNew Guinea style cannibalism. He was of course speaking of His figurative body\\nand blood, which we partake in when we observe Holy Communion, a practice that\\nbegan 2000 years before Christ came to Earth, as demonstrated by Abraham and\\nMelchizedek in Genesis 14:18. So, why do we take other Scriptural accounts\\nthat were meant to be taken figuratively, literally? There are accounts in\\nScripture that were written in Hebrew and Aramaic and both of these languages\\ntend to use polite words for things, places and situations that may be\\nindiscreet to mention in decent company. For instance, the word that would\\nliterally be translated as carnal copulation or coitus between a man and a\\nwoman is referred to as knowledge or know in the Old Testament of Scripture.\\nSo, when Genesis 4:1 says “Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare\\nCain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.” The word knew in question\\nis the Hebrew word ya-da‘ and it is a polite way of saying that Adam had\\ncoitus with Eve. That word is used in various tenses and adjectives of the\\nword know, including knew, knowledge, knowing and to know. Bear this in mind,\\nas I will connect the dots later. But first, let me share a first hand account\\nof a girl who once lived and may still live in the ancient city of Benin. It\\nis a true story. Have you ever known or grown up with or watched an innocent,\\nchaste young girl grow up? If you had, you will know that young girls can be\\nquite impressionable and easily swayed. For instance, I know of a young girl\\nin Benin, an ancient city in Nigeria, in the early 90s who was like that. So\\ninnocent. So bashful. So chaste and pure. Until one day, this girl changed.\\nWhat happened to her? A certain big man in the neighbourhood had taken\\nadvantage of her. No. It was not rape. This big man (now an ex Senator) was\\npopular in the neighbourhood for his wealth and his philandering ways.\\nApparently, he had his eyes set on this innocent girl and one day, he\\n‘innocently’ gave her a lift, propositioned her, and in her naivety, she got\\ncarried away, and this man had carnal knowledge of her and they became\\nhabitual lovers. It was clear to the whole neighbourhood that this girl had\\nchanged. Her eyes became open. She lost her innocence. Her natural hair was no\\nlonger good enough for her. She got a perm. And her terracotta skin would no\\nlonger do. It was a case of Tura to the rescue. The more she invested in Tura\\ncream, the shinier and lighter she became. Her dressing also changed. She\\nbecame a Lolita. She would no longer talk to us, small boys and girls, in the\\nneighbourhood. Her level had changed. She was now above us. She became a sisi.\\nI do not know if this word is still in use in today’s Nigeria, but those\\nNigerians known as Bendelites, would catch my drift. And then her sugar daddy\\ntired of her, or maybe not. Maybe he just found a new impressionable young\\ngirl fresh out of secondary school and moved on. I do not know which. You\\nnever quite know with these things. But in any case, she became another in the\\nlong list of neighbourhood girls he had used and dumped. The above is a true\\nstory. I know the name of the girl, the name of the ex Senator and the\\nneighbourhood were this occurred in Benin, Nigeria. But why is it relevant? It\\nis relevant because it is an example of how an innocent girl can lose her\\ninnocence and literally have her eyes opened by having a sexual encounter. I\\nhave read the Scriptures from cover to cover and in multiple translations as\\nwell as in English, Greek (New Testament), Aramaic and Hebrew. I have also\\nvisited Israel, Greece, Rome, Ethiopia, Turkey and many other places in search\\nof deeper insight into Scripture. How well do you know the Scriptures? I have\\na secondary school friend named Kehinde, who is now sort of a pastor and he\\nwrote on Facebook that he has jettisoned all other translations of The Holy\\nBible and he just holds to his King James Version jeje (a Yoruba word meaning\\ngently), and I laughed. If only he knew! If you have only read one translation\\nof Scripture, I urge you to read another one. And then another. A lot is lost\\nin translation. For example, if I converted $100 into pounds today, I may get\\n£80.30. But if I tried to buy back $100 with that £80.30, I would not be able\\nto. Why? Because value is always lost in the conversion process. It is the\\nsame with Scripture. Scripture was not written in English. It was written in\\nHebrew, Aramaic and Greek. And when Scripture is translated, a lot of value is\\nlost. That is why you should read multiple translations. But the best is to\\nteach yourself the original languages or learn them professionally, then read\\noriginal manuscripts in their mother language. Why? Because Scripture was\\ninspired by God, but translations were, in many cases, inspired by men. Men,\\nlike King James, who had his own agenda. You have probably read Matthew 11:12\\nin the King James Version, which says: “And from the days of John the Baptist\\nuntil now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by\\nforce.” The truth is that what the original Greek says and what the KJV above\\nsays, are almost as different as night and day. You read the above and feel\\nlike taking the kingdom “by force”. But that is because it was translated at\\nthe behest of a king who had a conqueror’s mentality. Let us read that verse\\nin the New International Version and see if you will even recognise it: “From\\nthe days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been\\nsubjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it.” Now, let us\\nread it in the Contemporary English Version: “From the time of John the\\nBaptist until now, violent people have been trying to take over the kingdom of\\nheaven by force.” Or consider Isaiah 45:11 in the King James Version, which\\nsays: “Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of\\nthings to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command\\nye me.” Now, it appears to indicate that God wants us to command Him about the\\nworks of His hand. But, you must understand that that is what a King wants to\\nhear, and since he paid for the translation, that is what his translators gave\\nhim. But read it in the New International Version. “This is what the LORD\\nsays– the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Concerning things to come, do you\\nquestion me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?”\\nLet us also read the Contemporary English Version: “I am the LORD, the\\nCreator, the holy God of Israel. Do you DARE question me about my own nation\\nor about what I have done?” You can see from the NIV and CEV, that God is\\nwarning us not to dare presume to command Him. He is God and we are man. He is\\nthe Creator and we are His creatures. Do you now see what translations can do?\\nHe who pays the translator dictates the translation. Take something like\\nleprosy. When you read the word leprosy in the King James Version, it is\\nrarely referring to what you know as leprosy. The Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek\\nwords translated as leprosy, often refer to a variety of skin diseases, but\\nthe translators could not find an exact meaning for them, so a choice was made\\nto call any skin disease leprosy. You have probably read or heard of Naaman,\\nthe head of the Syrian Army in 2 Kings chapter 5. He is referred to as a leper\\nin the KJV and many other English translations. But almost all scholars, and\\neven the translators of the KJV, put a cautionary note indicating that the\\nword leprosy, as used for Naaman, is a generic word for skin disease. It is\\nmore likely that Naaman had another type of skin infection. How do we know?\\nBecause, in those days, actual lepers were isolated and ostracised and it is\\nunlikely that a leper would rise to the trusted position as head of the king’s\\narmy and stand in the presence of the king. Leprosy was often infectious, and\\nin those days, they had little knowledge of which leprosy was infectious and\\nwhich was not. If you read Scripture, you would see that it is a truthful and\\nholy work and is the inspired word of God. However, the word of God in\\nProverbs 2:4 says that you cannot truly understand God’s wisdom except you\\n“seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures.” Turn to Songs\\nof Solomon 2:3 and you will read the following: “As the apple tree among the\\ntrees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his\\nshadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.” (KJV) Songs\\nof Solomon is a book believed to be written by King Solomon (its authorship is\\nnot certain) about the carnal intercourse of two young lovers. The theme is\\nabout the erotic intimacy of the lovers. But note how King Solomon (?) uses\\npolite words to describe the male lover. He is described as ‘the apple tree’,\\nwhile other men are described as ‘trees of the woods’. Next, notice how he\\ndescribes the coitus between them. The young female lover says ‘his fruit was\\nsweet to my taste’. So a tree means a man, and coitus is described as fruit\\nthat is sweet. In Rabbinical Judaism, Songs of Solomon 2:3 is said to\\nrepresent “the male sign of the covenant organ of procreation.” Remember those\\ndots I promised to connect? Now may be a good time to connect them, but I\\ndon’t want to connect them for you. Perhaps you can connect them yourself. I\\nwould not want to dwell too much on this issue other than to say that my\\nreaders should read the whole of Songs of Solomon chapter 2. When you have\\ndone so, consider reading Genesis chapters 2 and 3. And after you have done\\nso, sit back and think. Perhaps the Spirit would minister to you. In fact,\\nWilliam Shakespeare borrowed (or stole?) lines from Songs of Solomon in\\nseveral of his works including Romeo and Juliet. Some think, and I agree with\\nthem, that he did this because in Elizabethan England, coitus was considered\\ntoo unseemly for decent conversation and so it had to be referred to in\\nallegorical terms, which the Songs of Solomon does in a way that no other work\\nof human origin does. Why am I writing this? I am writing this to remind, or\\nperhaps to inform my readers for the very first time (if they did not already\\nknow this), that Scripture is an esoteric book that should not be read, but\\nstudied. The word of God says: “STUDY to shew thyself approved unto God, a\\nworkman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”-2\\nTimothy 2:15. Study. What a simple word. But a deep word, nevertheless. It is\\na word that runs very deep. It means that you read, in an unhurried pace. Then\\nyou ponder over what you have read. Medicate and meditate on it. Chew it over,\\nuntil it permeates your soulish man and crosses over to your spirit man, where\\ntrue understanding is. For as Job 32:8 says: “there is a spirit in man: and\\nthe inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.” In this part of\\nthe world, we are very lazy to study and as this is the case, we easily fall\\nprey to people who depend on REVELATION rather than ELUCIDATION by studying\\nScripture. But in reality, IT IS WRITTEN is a far more accurate way to stave\\noff spiritual error, than THE SPIRIT TOLD ME. May God bless you and open your\\neyes to understand His word and may He feel you with the urge to “Search the\\nscriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:”-John 5:39.

              "  'content': 'HOW DO YOU SEE ME?By Abu Zayd Sodiq AdeotiAll praises and adorations is due to\\nAllāh the most merciful, we beseech His blessings upon the noblest of mankind\\nMuhammad ﷺ.The current happenings across the global community has blotted the\\nlife of humans, causing a decrease in the spectre of mental and general\\nwellness. It appears that there is a reduced appreciation of human value and\\nquality of life in this period of existence. Several reasons have been\\nregistered as probable etymology of these problems. These occurrences are seen\\nat every strata of human relation (families, couples, friends and relatives).\\nHowever, it appears that a possible underlying cause is the loss of the normal\\nspiritual and mental perception of how we should see our fellow humans. Ask\\nyour neighbor, HOW DO YOU SEE ME?In the present day, there is a distinct\\norientation on how we value the wellbeing of fellow humans and this has\\nexposed us to many difficulties and sad occurrences. We tend to easily forget\\nthat there is an architect behind the existence of every creation and each\\nsoul belongs to Him (Allāh) alone. Allāh says in the Qur\\'an: \" Verily We\\ncreated man from a product of wet earth; then placed him as a drop (of seed)\\nin a safe lodging; then We fashioned the drop into a clot, then We fashioned\\nthe clot into a little lump, then We fashioned the little lump into bones,\\nthen clothed the bones with flesh, and then produced it another creation. So\\nblessed be Allāh, the Best of Creators\". (Q23:12-14).It is very essential we\\nascribe importance to the worth of every soul as they belong to Allāh only,\\nand see our fellow humans in our image and not met any harm on them. Allāh\\nsays: “and do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except for the\\nrequirements of justice; this He has enjoined you with that you may\\nunderstand”. (Q6:151). This is an obligation upon us not to take the souls of\\nothers unjustly. How about toying with their mental health which can lead to\\nloss of life? Of the common happenings, is the assault of the female gender\\nthat ravages the global community. Regardless of our gender, we must see\\nourselves as elements of trust and high value. A very bad motive is like a\\ndisease which when the effects reaches a person, it possibly cause a long\\nlasting complication that may dwindle the sweetness of ones life journey. The\\nProphet ﷺ said: \"None of you [truly] believes until he loves for his brother\\nthat which he loves for himself\". This emphasizes the fact that our\\nrelationships as Muslims should be built on natural affection while not\\ntransgressing the limits of Allāh. Aside from faulting ones Eeman by going\\nagainst the teachings of Islam, the implications of meting harm in any form\\nare grave. Commonly, incidence of physical assaults, betrayal, cheating and\\nall forms of minor attacks on one another has dwindled the quality of\\nexistence leaving many with emotional imbalance and death in some cases.\\nResearch has shown that experiences of terror has grave effects on one\\'s\\nmental stability and health. Victims of these actions tend to suffer long or\\nshort term emotional and psychological trauma which doesn’t favor their mental\\nwellness. Hence, it is essential we live a life built upon a sequence of core\\nvalues in spiritual, physical and mental health. This can only come to\\nfruition when we accustom ourselves to the teachings of Allāh and His\\nMessenger ﷺ, thereby serving as a guide on how we co-manage the spiritual and\\nmental wellbeing of ourselves and fellow humans.As Muslims, it is essential we\\nrelate with one another with utmost level of respect regardless of our gender,\\nrace or color. The Prophet ﷺ said: \"A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim: he\\ndoes not oppress him, nor does he fail him, nor does he lie to him, nor does\\nhe hold him in contempt\". A positive reverse on the perceptions of humanity is\\nessential for every individual. See not your fellow human as a material of\\nordinary physical resemblance, object of attack or an instrument of exercising\\nbad imaginations. Rather, we should see ourselves as an entity of priceless\\nvalue, trust, worth and love so as to make the world a better place.THIS IS\\nHOW I WANT YOU TO SEE ME.

              "  'content': 'GOD AND MARRIAGEGen. 2:18-25Bob Marcaurellehomeorchurchbiblestudy.comWhat is\\nmarriage? There are all kinds of definitions. To some it is “the quickest way\\nto kill a good romance.”To a live-in girlfriend put in the street it is “a\\npiece of paper that guarantees I will get some money for all the time I invest\\nin a bad relationship.”To some it is “the answer to most of my problems” and\\nto others it is “where most of my problems began”.Going to Genesis two, in the\\nGarden of Eden, where God conducted the first wedding and formed the first\\nmarriage we find this possible definition. It is the union of one man and one\\nwoman by the will of God into a growing relationship of love for life.A. A\\nPURPOSEFUL UNIONMarriage in the Bible fulfills four purposes God has for\\nmankind. The first is to populate the earth. In God tells Adam and Eve to “be\\nfruitful and multiply.”The second is to avoid loneliness. InGod says for the\\nfirst time in the creation account that something is NOT good. He said, “It is\\nnot good for the man to be alone.”The third purpose, stated by Paul, is to\\nsatisfy sexual desires. In Paul says, “. . .it is better to marry than to burn\\nwith passion.”The fourth is to be a character building agency to produce godly\\nchildren. Malachi says in,“Has not the Lord made them one?” And why one?\\nBecause He was seeking godly offspring.Between birth and maturity a child\\nlives 108,000 hours. Seven thousand are spent in public school. One thousand\\nare spent in church. And ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND are spent in the home, under the\\ninfluence of parents. Here is where a child learns the proper or the improper\\nvalues he carries into adulthood.Another definition of marriage I would like\\nto offer is - marriage is where you find your heaven or hell in life. If you\\nare not happy in your marriage you will not be a happy person. Your life will\\nbe a living hell. If you are happy in your marriage you will be a happy\\nperson. You will experience a little touch of heaven on earth.\\n\\n',\n",

But I will like to say that testimony happens only when we know what\\nto do to provoke it. So, if you will experience your testimony this month,\\naccording to the story of the woman with the issue of blood in today\\'s text,\\nyou must believe what God can do as pointed out yesterday. She believed God\\'s\\nability and this provoked the manifestation of her testimony. What more can we\\nlearn from her story?2: BE DESPERATE FOR YOUR CHANGE OF STORY: The Bible says:\\n\"When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his\\ngarment\" (Mk 5:27). She was desperate enough not to allow the crowd to\\ndiscourage her. She pressed until she got what she wanted. Are you desperate\\nenough to see your miracle this month? This woman got her miracle because she\\nwas desperate for a change. You can get yours too. To be desperate means \"To\\nbe ready to take any risk for a desired change.\" What risk have you or are you\\nready to take?Now, what is in this prayer and fasting for me? prayer and\\nfasting is ordained to break the barriers in life. Life often comes with\\ndiverse challenges. There is need to always fast and pray to receive divine\\nstrength needed to overcome those challenges. This shall happen in your life\\nduring and after this fasting.PRAYER: Any barrier between you and your\\ntestimony is broken today in Jesus name!DAY 3 PRAYER GUIDELINES:1: Father in\\nthe name of Jesus, let every barren area of my life be fruitful this month\\n(Gen 1:28).2: Father, every barrier to my testimony this month be broken in\\nJesus name (Joshua 6:20).3: Present to God any other request.You will surely\\ntestify!1 YEAR BIBLE READING PLAN:July 3 (Job 25-27; Acts 12)Kindly share this\\nmessage with your contacts!\\n\\n',\n",

Reflections!Some persons immediately jumped into this thread\\nseeking for my blood like the infamous Bagauda Mosquitoes, without trying\\ntheir possible best to find out why I made the assertion. I forgive you anyway\\nbut do not try it again next time, because unlike you, I do not practice law\\nwhere bail is granted in the most liberal terms .

He has practically held me in his hands, without me knowing what\\nwas happening around me.Sometimes, I look back, and the only conclusion I can\\nonly arrive at, is, \"Na God Do am \" meaning it can only be God. But why will\\nit be God when I don\\'t even know him?People of God, Another question I have\\nalso asked myself is why him?I still remember how He and big Roonie\\npractically walked me to Living Faith Church, Ekpoma, aka Winner\\'s chapel at\\nShiloh 2010 or 11 were is cured of acute heart palpitations and related\\nproblems. That was the year Bishop Adeboye, the religious- mathematician\\nteacher, came to Shiloh. It was one of those chilly evenings, and I was in my\\nshop when he moved me to the church and healed me. I still remember every tiny\\nlittle details. I know how I was always in and out of hospital before the\\ncure. Though I was born in a Christain home, I wasn\\'t much of a Christain and\\na church goer. My Mama was churchy and religious, and my Dad has been busy\\nlooking for God outside of him, forgetting that the Bible once quoted that the\\n\"kingdom of God is within thee.\"I learnt about the religion of Harish Kristna,\\nGrail Message and Eckankar from his library. I acquired basic knowledge from\\nhis modest collections. I regretted not collecting those books. They just went\\nto waste. He was a writer in his secondary days; his dreams were to become a\\nMedical Doctor. He was sponsoring himself school when love came and his brain\\nstopped working. He is still a paragon of beauty in her old age and this makes\\nme wonder, how beautiful she could have been at that age. He quickly got mum\\ngot pregnant, and everything changed. He assumed the responsibilities of\\nraising a family and became a businessman and a farmer. He was brilliant, and\\nhe is still very much bright and has always been. I am proud to call him\\nfather I think he is still mad at himself for not eventually fulfilling his\\ndreams of becoming a doctor. He is prosperous and happy kind of, but he is not\\nsatisfied.I have always asked him to back to school and become, but he has\\nrefused my entreaties. However, he is fulfiled and happy businessman. He is\\nmore of a traditionalist than he is a Christain. I won\\'t blame him, because my\\nfore-fathers from both sides were core traditionalists, and to make matters\\nworse for me, I also married from a linage of one. This is a story for another\\nday. He was the one who insisted I become a lawyer, though he didn\\'t pay a\\ndime for me as school fees. I disowned him and suspended his rights as a\\nfather when I was still a teenager. I wanted to study economics or join the\\narmy, but he won\\'t let me be.So, we were always at loggerheads. The man\\nbeats.hit out of me until he tire, he come become preacher. E preach from\\nGenesis, come begin dey near Exodus, I don park my paperbag and foam comot\\nfrom house wen e use e own money build.He always told me since I was 4 years\\nold, that a man is always a man and the earlier you realise you are a man and\\nassume responsibilities, the better for you, your wife and your children.I\\njust bought my first company then, so it was easy to leave the house. They\\ntaught me business at a tender age, and that is another reason to be grateful\\nto Divine Providence as used by Napoleon Hills, in his books \" Outwitting the\\ndevil and Think and Grow Rich\". or Jehovah, as the Jehovah Witnesses\\nprofoundly call Him. You gain more insight I can recommend son J.W articles\\nand materials, especially \" Daniel\\'s Prophecy\". It is an excellent book. Their\\ndecision to throwing me into a community of Igbo businessmen and women is\\nperhaps, one of the greatest blessings God ever gave me. My first company was\\nan opportunity to start something real and implement my learnings, and\\nobservations from the Igbo businessmen. I was ready to put my acquired skill\\nset into practice. I have always wondered why an Igbo selling and making a\\nprofit of 10 naira per item could control billions of nairas, and while his\\ncounterpart from the other part of the country with his numerous degrees was\\nsuch as B.Sc, LL.B, B.L, MBA, JST, GST, M.A, D.A, GLO & MTN and with salaried\\njobs in the banks were struggling for their attention, and a majority of them\\nare S.S.C.E and Primary School certificate holder. He came to take courses in\\nbusiness management. Well! That was until I stumbled upon Robert Kiyosaki\\'s \"\\nRich and Happy, Don\\'t Go To School\".Well, the company was a registered\\nbusiness venture with a wide range of objects. I was reading a couple of other\\nbooks by Clarkeson and Robert Kiyosaki, and I could also put them to practice.\\nI like the Richest Man in Babylon and who took my money. Trumps \" Why we want\\nyou to be rich\" and Kiyosaki\\'\\'s Conspiracy of the rich\" all books that will\\ngive you torrents of braingasms like the kind I got from \" Mario Puzo\\'s \" 4th\\nK\". Braingasm in literature started with books by Williams Shakespeare, George\\nOrwell, Chinua Achebe, Elechi Amai, Aryi Kwe Armah, Ngugi Wa ti\\' Ogo,\\nChimamanda Adiche.So, sacking him from life and moving out of the house for\\nthe first real decision I ever made in my life. I didn\\'t even make plans for\\nwhat if the business failed. I had businesses that paid our bills, and thank\\nGod for his mercies; he gave me a woman, whose shoulder I could cry on during\\nthe dark days that came with trying to struggle it out on my own. That was all\\nthat mattered, or so I erroneously thought.

              "  'content': 'There are many interesting parts of the Jewish scriptures, but I find\\nintriguing, the message contained in Parashat Pinchas (rendered as Phinehas in\\nThe Bible), regarding Leadership and Succession. It starts in Numbers, with\\nthe act of Phinehas, a grandson of Aaron, who like other Israelites at the\\ntime was saddened by the action of a certain Zimri, who had brought in a\\nMidianite woman into the camp while the children of Israel were in the\\nwilderness, mourning the loss of loved ones who\\'d fallen victims to a plague\\nas a result of disobedience to YAHWEH in committing fornication and idolatry\\nwith Midianite women. Rather than simply joining the others in bemoaning the\\nfate of Israel, while watching Zimri have sexual intercourse with the said\\nwoman, and doing nothing about it, Phinehas took the initiative by slaying\\nboth with a spear, which he thrust through them while they were still in the\\nact. His zeal earned him recognition before YAHWEH, and he was thereafter\\npromised and given HIS \"...COVENANT OF PEACE, ... a Covenant of an Everlasting\\nPriesthood, because he was zealous for his Elohim\".This sort of zealousness\\nwas captured in the book of Kings, when Eliyah rid the land of Israel of its\\nprophets of Baal, and despite all efforts to capture him, and make him pay by\\nthe powers that was of those days, YAHWEH protected him, and in the end, he\\ngot a Moses like type of ending in that no one knew exactly how and where he\\ndied and was buried, as he was whisked from the midst of those who last saw\\nhim, though not without relinquishing some of his powers to his successor,\\nElisha who had doggedly followed, observed and studied under Eliyah\\'s\\ntutelage. In the book of John, Yahshua was said to have also exhibited\\nPhinehas\\' character, when he upturned tables of merchants and traders in the\\ntemple at Jerusalem at the time. The trio displayed characters that showed an\\nuncompromising nature when it came to jealously guarding the things of and\\nabout YAHWEH, and they were duly rewarded. Even though, Phinehas was sure to\\nbecome priest after his father Eleazar, by his action he personally earned it\\nby his own right, unlike his father Eleazar who was anointed simply because\\nhis father Aaron had been priest before him. Phinehas showed his mettle, and\\neven before he could be anointed to take his father\\'s place, got YAHWEH\\'s\\nrecognition, and secured not just his place, but that of his offspring forever\\nbefore HIM. We find instances today of sons of pastors, taking over from their\\nfathers, following in the line of Aaron and his sons, as YAHWEH commanded\\nMoses thus to be and do, but Eleazar showed that even with a predetermined\\nsuccession plan, one could also prove himself worthy of the position. It is\\nthe lack of this, that is sometimes responsible for the collapse of many\\nreligious establishments bequeathed to sons, wives, husbands, or family\\nmembers, after the demise of the founders of such places, or even if they\\nsurvive, remain only a shadow of what they used to be either spiritually or\\nphysically.There was some sort of schism amongst the disciples of Yahshua, who\\nlater became apostles after he transcended. This had to do with his brother\\nJames wanting to takeover the mantle of leadership. Had his opponents, who\\'d\\nshown better leadership qualities not adopted Yahshua\\'s maxim of \"those not\\nagainst us, are for us\", in terms of the message they were preaching, they\\nmight have burnt the house down. Their decision to come to some sort of\\naccommodation by and for all sides is why Messianic Judaism and Christianity\\nis a thing today. The situation with Elisha was in stark contrast to what\\nobtained above. Before Eliyah\\'s translation, even the blind and deaf amongst\\nhis followers (so called \"sons of the prophet\", could see and hear\\nrespectively, and knew that Elisha was the chosen one, and it did bode well\\nfor them, such that before long, their ranks swelled to the point at which\\ntheir common abode couldn\\'t contain them any longer, necessitating a move,\\nwhere the miracle of the axe head, became a part of the story. Could a\\nrelative of Eliyah have gone as far as Elisha had, if same had been favoured\\nby the former to take over from him, just to ensure the ministry remained in\\nthe family? Would s/he have been as great as Elisha, whose bones, years after\\nhe\\'d died, caused the dead hurriedly dropped into his grave to rise, amongst\\nthe many great things YAHWEH caused to happen through him while he lived?\\nIndeed, if it is YAHWEH\\'s will that in all situations, sons, daughters, or\\nother family members should take over from relative who\\'d led a congregation\\nwhile alive, no one should have been better qualified than Moses\\' sons, but we\\ndon\\'t see them mentioned anywhere. In fact, in this portion, YAHWEH declared\\nthat Joshua (Yahshua) the son of Nun be anointed Moses\\' successor. Moses\\'\\nchildren appeared not to have showed up at all, like Phinehas did with the\\nburning desire to protect the statutes and ordinances of YAHWEH, at the risk\\nof earning the anger of those he sought to protect, and in the end buying them\\nreprieve from YAHWEH\\'s anger. Nothing is written about their thoughts, so I\\'d\\nrather not speculate about the actions and inactions of the sons of Moses\\nwhile he held sway, however one can guess that the fact that Aaron\\'s sons were\\nquite visible, including Nadab and Abihu who got their fingers burnt, in fact\\ndied in their overzealousness, ensured that the family was remembered in a lot\\nof things, and ways. During the census everyone, every family through their\\nmales got a mention, and allocation in the land they were just about to\\novertake in Canaan, interestingly the name of the sons of Moses, was kind of\\nmissing.Talking about the census, the five daughters of Zelophehad who had\\ndied without a son, petitioned Moses, and when Moses inquired of YAHWEH, got\\nland apportioned to them, which will remain with them, and/or with the tribe\\ndepending on their martial choices. So you see, before YAHWEH it matters if we\\nshow up, and be interested in things pertaining to him, as Yahshua admonished\\nus to seek first YAHWEH\\'s kingdom, and every other thing will be added to us.\\nIn the case of succession, interest should trump over lineage, even though it\\nwould be nice if both factors can be found, except YAHWEH\\'s will be otherwise.\\nFailure to do this, will hardly augur well for the congregation, such that\\neven if things appear to be going well, it will be only a matter of time\\nbefore it is established that the salt has lost its taste, hence you see many\\nleaders of people augmenting their abilities with external forces that will do\\nmore harm than good, to the leader, and more so to the followers.

              "  'content': 'Reason I am doing this ? Just to share biblical knowledge on the word of God,\\nnot doing this for likes or attention. I know some of the things I will say\\nwont be liked by some people because it is going against the norms… but like I\\nsaid I am not doing this for Likes or Shares“Do not touch My anointed ones,\\nAnd do My prophets no harm.” (Psalm 105:15)[/i]There are some Bible verses\\nthat are misused and abused more often than they are correctly used. Today’s\\nverse is one of these. As the false teachers and prophets become more\\nprolific, touch not my anointed is thrown out repeatedly as a defensive weapon\\nto silence the voices of truth. It’s also used to justify abusive\\nleadership.The tragedy is that it sounds scriptural – because it is – and so\\nfew people think to question it or to find out what it really means. As a\\nresult, the spiritual power of proper discernment and is shut down under the\\nguise of being obedient to the Word of God. The devil, as revealed in the\\ntemptation of Christ, is very quick to use the Word to achieve his own ends.\\nIn this case, it’s the perpetuation of ungodly teachings and authority within\\nthe church.This verse specifically relates to God’s protection of His people –\\nHis anointed ones, those set apart for Him as patriarchs, priests, and\\nprophets and His people as a whole.There is an echo of this in the story of\\nDavid refusing to kill Saul in the caves because he was still God’s anointed\\nking. From this, we can see that God’s anointing included His people as a\\nwhole but also extended to individuals whom He had anointed for a particular\\npurpose or service. The common factor here is [i]those belonging to\\nHim[i][/i][/b].[b][b]Touch not my anointed in the church.[/b]I’ve lost count\\nof how many self-proclaimed ‘anointed prophets’ and teachers have lashed out\\nusing this verse to shut down the voice of truth or perceived criticism of\\ntheir ministry. Anytime they are confronted with the real truth of the Word of\\nGod, out will come this accusation. It’s an extremely aggressive tactic,\\nbecause it threatens with the vengeance of God. It effectively silences anyone\\nwho doesn’t yet know the Word or doesn’t understand what this verse really\\nmeans.The other area where this is horribly abused is in ‘validating’ ungodly\\nleadership – the kind that seeks to control and manipulate believers. In this\\nscenario, the pastor or eldership team reinforce their power by using the\\ntouch not my anointed card. They create the perception in believers that\\nleadership is inviolate. Because they are anointed by God they are beyond\\nreproach and cannot be questioned. This is an extremely dangerous spiritual\\nplace, the breeding ground of many religious cults that are actually offshoots\\nof genuine Bible-believing churches. The Word of God commands us to judge all\\nthings by the Word. If we receive teaching that does not conform to the Word,\\nit is our responsibility to question it. Pastors, prophets, and teachers are\\nall human and therefore fallible.[b]Touch not my anointed is for every\\nbeliever.[/b]In Christ, every single born-again, Spirit-filled believer is\\nanointed of God. Today’s verse applies to every one of us. It’s our promise\\nthat no matter what happens to us, God Himself will enforce the consequences\\nof this warning. He does not say His people won’t be persecuted, tortured, or\\neven martyred. There are places in the world where this is happening. But we\\ncan hold on to the absolute truth that belonging to God is to be among the\\nanointed.Thank you for readingNote worthy contribution -\\nhttp://truthimmutable.com\\n\\n',\n",

              "  'content': 'Seeds Of DestinyFACTS ON FAITH 28 June 2020CLICK HERE TO READ MORE Seeds of\\ndestiny & other daily devotional here The results we experience in life are\\ndirectly proportional to the height of our faith.SCRIPTURE: We are bound to\\nthank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith\\ngroweth exceedingly….2 Thessalonians 1:3THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: The size of your\\nfaith determines the size of your results in life. Faith is a Spiritual\\nconstruction that can be built or constructed. It is a spiritual seed that\\ngrows. Faith is in levels. We are not all at the same level of faith because\\nwe are not all committed to the growth of our faith at the same level. So,\\nyour commitment to the growth of your faith affects the degree of victory you\\nexperience in life (1 John 5:4). The results we experience in life are\\ndirectly proportional to the height of our faith.Now, we are going to explore\\nseven key facts about faith.1. Faith is in Levels or Sizes. Faith is in\\nvarious levels and degrees. There is the level of no faith (Mark 4:40); there\\nis another level called a measure of faith (Romans 12:3); there is also the\\nlevel of little faith (Matthew 14:31, Matthew 16:, and then the level of great\\nfaith (Matthew 15:28). This is very important because the size of your faith\\ndetermines the size of your results.2. Faith differs in strength or capacity.\\nThere is a weak faith (Romans 14:1), and there is a strong faith (Romans\\n4:20).3. Faith can be sound or sick (Titus 1:13). A sound faith is a\\nfunctional, effective, working, agile, energetic or healthy faith. A sick\\nfaith is a lethargic and afflicted faith.4. Faith can fail (Luke 22:31). There\\ncan be faith failure. And faith failure can be worse than brake failure and\\nheart failure. Faith failure can make disaster in life and destiny\\ninevitable.5. Faith can be dead or alive (James 2:20). There is a living faith\\nand a dead faith. When a man’s faith is dead, life is in danger. When faith\\ndies destiny is buried.6. Faith attracts fights (1 Timothy 6:12). As we\\napproach the end of the age, faith in God is an endangered species but it must\\nbe preserved. You must contend for your faith (Jude 1:4). Determine to fight\\nconsistently to ensure that the devil does not dilute your faith with doubt,\\nfear and compromise.7. Faith requires work for building and growing (2\\nThessalonians 1:11).Faith is work. It takes work to walk the walk of faith. It\\ntakes work to build and grow faith. Remember this: The size of your faith\\ndetermines the size of your results in life.

              "  'content': \"First, i will say that according to the scripture, Many are called but among\\nthem' those who obey the calling are chosen. We must live for God and God\\nalone. And what ever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord\\nJesus, giving thanks to God the father colossians 3:17. But bring here those\\nenemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them,, and slay them before\\nme Luke 19:27. That you have a calling must not be that you must be a pastor,\\nminister and what at view. But many have the calling of vision,prophecy and\\nrevelation, some for healing. Here am going to share with you my revelation of\\nthe coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in no time now. Please i may not be good\\nwriter or good user of words but i pray that you all will understand this\\nrevelation and turn to Christ the savior. On the august 2016, after i lost my\\nelder sister and our last born, just a month after. I had a dream. There this\\nour anty, she is married whom we are family friends to, they had no\\nrelationship with our parents in any form. I became a family friends through\\nthe husband while my friend was by Neighbour. Most time we live at the\\nbenevolent of this couple as well as we help them with house chores. Now in my\\ndream just as usual, this woman normally come home late or closely late at\\nnight, so one day she came late about after 10 to 11 pm there was nothing for\\ndinner neither did she come back with some food stuff for dinner. So she gave\\nus money to buy bread and some things for tea. Then we went out in the night\\nlooking for shop that was still open fortunately for us we found one, a\\nsupermarket, a storey building. So we went up to buy the things, we met an old\\nwoman who was above 60years old, who was handling the shop so we made the\\norder. We requested for chocolate and milk but this woman didn't understand us\\nbut keeps giving us detergent all our effort Trying to make this women\\nunderstand our request proven abortive until the last 4th effort, just as she\\nwas about giving us our exact demand. Something extraordinary and fascinating\\nhappened. We were all alongside with those who were also buying, surrounded by\\nall kinds of forces be it military, parliamentary name it & we're order not 2\\nmove less we die. to my knowledge i demanded for something that will satisfied\\nour desire, something that will quench our hunger meanwhile this woman was\\nbusy giving us detergent(klin). Something that is use for washing unclean\\nthings. To my own idea, she was giving us chance to purge and clean our selves\\nfrom our uncleanness but we were busy demanding what we desire. And again the\\nbible says the coming of our lord Jesus Christ will be like a thief in the\\nnight. This mean to no one knowledge in the next minutes,hour,months,weeks,\\nyear or years and even the next second should anyone hence know the coming of\\nJesus Christ be it morning,afternoon or evening no one knows. In other words,\\na woman or a man who is single lock his or her house and went out upon coming\\nback with no expectant open the padlock went inside just to be startled at the\\nseeing of his or her father or mother sitting in the rest room. None of them\\nwere inform nor did they have the key to the padlock but he was caught up in\\nthe moment. This is how it will be. We were caught up unaware in this dream.\\nWhy, because we were not expecting such thing. Imaging night turning into a\\nday within an instance like it was waiting for us to fail to acknowledge the\\nreal fact. We are not looking for the things which are eternal. 2corinthians\\n4:18; while we do not look at the things which are seen, for the things which\\nare seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Now back\\nin the dream. We were moved to a very very deserted place. A place for trial\\nand torture. This place were also people who are brought from different part\\nand location in the world. And we were like fresher. In this place all sort of\\ndemons and satanist followers were present there and they torture both\\nChristian and non Christian, believers and non believers, good people and bad\\nones. Mother and father, uncle and even children. So we sat on a bench behind\\na dumped bus at the right side of the bus facing towards to the torture field.\\nTypically the place look like a place where massive war occurred and every\\nthing was damage both vehicles, houses,roads,bridge, churches and schools\\nevery where was so deserted like a typical war movie. While we were waiting\\nfor trial as they were massive security like we were in captivity, then i saw\\ntwo young boys both was covered in thick black oil like its crude oil or\\ncondemned oil i don't know, but all i know is this boy was lamenting due to\\nthe extensive torture that get up to a point, he wishing for his own death to\\ncome quickly while the other was very very weak, this cause me grieve. A few\\nmoment i was press and wanted to ease my self so i walk straight to one of the\\nofficer to ask for where\\n\\n\",\n",
              "  'response': 'So i walk towards one of the officer to ask for where i can piss, he pointed\\nto one deep bottomless pit while i was about urinating a strong forces was\\ntrying to pull me into it out of fear i fell back on the ground with my feet\\nstill on it point and the army man bust in a mockery amusement. I went back to\\nmy sit, on my both side were my friends, none was my initial friend which i\\nwent with to the shop at night to buy things for dinner, even before we were\\ntaken out from the shop i couldn\\'t find him again. \"do not be deceived, God is\\nnot mocked; for what ever a man sow, that he will reap galatians 6:7-9 verse 8\\nfor the one who sow to his own flesh, will from his own flesh reap corruption,\\nbut the one who sow to the Spirit reap eternal life. Verse 9 let us not lose\\nheart in doing good, for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary. It\\nis very certain that we do not work in the will of God but in the will of our\\nflesh God help us. Now while we sat on, a great dragon was approaching and\\nalso descending, on it was a young man, he had tattoo on his body. His\\nappearance looks like a musician typically look like one of the American\\nrapper. While the dragon was descending this man on it transform into a real\\nman of devil(satan) with red head two horns and fangs. He landed at our back\\nat the other side of the bus and started coming to where we were, the kind of\\nodour that i perceived from this devil was very unpleasing and unbearable\\npossibly you will vomit you intestine. In other not to provoke or draw his\\nattention because of the odour i pretended as if i was urinating after that we\\nwere all set for torment on our way for torments suddenly i woke up and i felt\\na strong urge to share the revelation and if i don\\'t i will be hold\\naccountable for it. this is what runs through my mind. Another dream i had\\nwas, towards evening about 7 to 8 pm in my dream; i was sent out to buy some\\nstuff while i was about climbing the stair case, a thick storm formed, there\\nwas strong thunder and lightning like it was about to rain but clearly it\\nwasn\\'t raining, every where was very Dark like a horror movie. People were\\nrunning to take cover, the world was almost doomed. Then i saw a forming\\ncloud, forming an angel of God with trumpet in his hand. as this cloud almost\\nformed an angel and was about blowing the trumpet, a young boy step into it\\nand it vanished away another man came asking us to praise God that what was\\nabout happening was rapture that someone intercede for us and God gave us\\nanother chance. Many of us are no living the life we are suppose to live, a\\nlife that is not giving glory to God. Matthew 5:18; for assuredly, i say to\\nyou, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one title will by no means\\npass from the law till all is fulfilled. We most live a righteous life. 1\\nSamuel 15:22-23; then Samuel said: \" has the Lord as Great delight in burnt\\noffering and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord. Behold, to obey\\nis better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of ram. Verse 23; for\\nrebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and\\nidolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he also has rejected\\nyou from being king. We have to obey God and i plead with you to turn to God\\nfor mercy and God will deliver us amen.\\n\\n',\n",

The Bible in Ephesians 5:23 says:“For the husband is\\nthe head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church…”The husband is\\nthe head of the wife. No matter how educated or successful you are, your\\nhusband is your head and you must regard him as such at all times. It is a\\nterrible thing for a husband to feel his wife is his head.Many men are\\nmisbehaving in their marriages simply because they want to establish that they\\nare the head of their wives.Also, my wife is my number one fan.She wrote in\\nthe book Mathematics of Marriage – which we coauthored, that as my helpmate\\nshe knows she cannot help mewithout my instructions, so when they come, her\\nresponse is Yes sir.Busy as she is, she still cooks my meals and serves me\\nherself. Many young ladies these days leave everything to the house help. My\\nwife still trims my nails for me.There was a time when I was a teacher and was\\nstaying far from town. She had to cut my hair during that period. She is the\\nonly partner of the Adeboye Corporation; she doesn’t delegate her primary\\nduties to anyone else.Just like the virtuous woman described in Proverbs\\n31:1-31, I safely rest on my wife.

In Antioch, an ancient\\nmetropolis where Greek was spoken, this name was given to those who recognised\\nJesus as the Christ, the Saviour sent by God. He brought “grace and truth”,\\nbut people rejected Him and crucified Him. God, however, raised Him up and\\nreceived Him in heaven. Since then this has been preached in the whole\\nworld.It can hardly have been Jews who gave the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth\\nthe name of “Christians”, for they themselves expected Christ, their Messiah,\\nwho had been announced by the prophets. But they refused to recognise the\\nMessiah in the Person of Jesus. Meanwhile the gospel had spread beyond\\nIsrael’s frontiers. People in the surrounding countries heard it and many\\nbelieved it. These believers, whether of Jewish origin or from pagan lands,\\nwere called “Christians” by the inhabitants of their environment.The title was\\nprobably also used derisively for those who, as Christians, worshipped One who\\nhad been crucified as their God. Yet what an honourable title it was for\\nChrist’s disciples!For centuries “Christian” is the general designation of\\ncountless persons, although it has lost much of its significance in the course\\nof time. Those who have been redeemed by Christ should bear the name in a\\nmanner worthy of Him by actually following Him.“If anyone suffers as a\\nChristian, let him not be ashamed, but let\\nhim...http://www.dailydevotionalsonline.com/devdetails.php?devotional=thegoodseed&&id;=4770\\n\\n',\n",

If you think the current crises Yemen is undergoing is in any way\\nhumane, and why has turned a blind eye to it is okay, it defeats the whole\\npurpose of having a Skye daddy watch over us. The narcissism exhibited by\\nreligious people irks me. They survive accidents and go to their places of\\nworship to give testimonials, very selfish and stupid acts. You can't\\nnegotiate with a psychopath\\n\\n\",\n",

Open Heaven for\\n2019 – So *MESSAGE:* Today’s Bible reading records a classical song of triumph\\nthat Moses and the Israelites sang after overcoming the Red Sea and Pharaoh’s\\nforces. After they were liberated from the shackles of slavery in Egypt, the\\nchildren of Israel were faced with the greatest battle of their lives when\\nthey found themselves trapped between the Red Sea before them and Pharaoh’s\\narmy behind. At that moment, they fell into a state of despair and murmured\\nagainst Moses and His God, who took them by His mighty hands out of the land\\nof Egypt. They forgot all the mighty works His did to bring them out, so much\\nso that He killed all the firstborns of Egypt. However, God had mercy on them,\\nand He overthrew Pharaoh’s plan to return them into slavery. After witnessing\\nGod’s great intervention on their behalf, songs of triumph filled their mouths\\nand they began to sing, even without any rehearsals. I prophesy to a user of\\nthis devotional today: you will experience a victory over your enemies that\\nwill put new songs of triumph in your mouth in Jesus’ Name. David faced so\\nmany battles in his life, but at the end of every battle his songs were always\\nsongs of triumph. For example, he sang in Psalm 124:1-3 , saying; “If it had\\nnot been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; If it had not been\\nthe LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: then they had\\nswallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:” Beloved, you\\nalso can sing many songs of triumph provided you choose the correct ally in\\nthe battles of life. Our God is a specialist in all forms of warfare – be it\\nground, underground, marine, underwater or air warfare, it doesn’t matter to\\nHim. What He did with Pharaoh and his hosts is a good example of his marine\\nand submarine warfare capabilities. The battle He fought for the Israelite's\\nin 1st Samuel chapter 7 is an example of His ground warfare abilities. In\\nExodus 9:18-25 , He showed His ability to fight from the air by sending\\nhailstones upon the Egyptians. Describing the mightiness of God in battle, the\\nHoly Spirit said Isaiah 12:5-6: “Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done\\nexcellent things: this is known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou\\ninhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.”\\nSo, if I were you, I would ensure that this God, who is mighty in battle, is\\nmy ally, and I would surrender every battle of my life to Him to fight in His\\nown way. Do this today, and you will always have songs of triumph to sing.\\nPRAYER POINT: Father, I come to You today, please be my Ally in the battles of\\nlife, and give me new songs of triumph over all my enemies, to the glory of\\nYour Name.

Adeboye , the General Overseer of the Redeemed\\nChristian Church of God, one of the largest evangelical Churches in the world\\nand also the President of Christ the Redeemer's Ministries.

              "  'response': 'OPEN HEAVENS DAILY DEVOTIONALDATE: THURSDAY 30th JANUARY 2020.THEME: LOVE WHAT\\nGOD LOVES.MEMORISE:For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:\\nand his commandments are not grievous. IJohn 5:3READ: 1John 5:1-31. Whosoever\\nbelieveth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth\\nhim that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.2 By this we know that\\nwe love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.3 For\\nthis is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments\\nare not grievous.MESSAGE There is a popular saying that the friend of my\\nfriend is my friend. If God is your friend, then you would love anyone or\\nanything He loves. For example, God loves children. He likes having them\\naround Him (Matthew 19:14) and He ensures that their angels stand face to face\\nwith Him (Matthew 18:10). I hope you love children too, because if you are\\nalways mean to children or you are indifferent when others are mean to them,\\nthen you cannot claim to love God.So what are the things God loves? He loves\\nfellowship. When Jesus was to start His ministry on earth, one of the first\\nthings He did was to appoint disciples to keep Him company (Mark 3:14-19). He\\nsaid whenever two or three are gathered in His name, He will be present\\n(Matthew 18:20). He loves it when we come together to fellowship. Are you\\nexcited when it is time to fellowship or are you reluctant to spend time with\\nthe brethren? One reason God loved David is found in Psalm 122:1: “I was glad\\nwhen they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.”He was always\\nexcited to attend Church meetings. Are you excited whenever it is time to go\\nto Church? Are you one of those the Pastor has to follow-up closely before\\nthey are seen in Church? Make out time to enjoy fellowship with the brethren\\nfrom today; God loves it.God also loves all human beings dearly. He sent His\\nonly son to die for the world-not just the Jews or Christians alone. Some\\npeople forget that their house help is also amongst the people that Jesus came\\nto die for so much that He died for him/her. Jesus said that the second\\ngreatest commandment after loving God is to love your neighbor as yourself\\n(Mark 12:31). Have you seen people in the scenarios described in Matthew\\n25:42-43 and ignored them? If you truly love God, then you would love people\\naround you.KEY POINT:In Matthew 25:41-46, we see that people were thrown into\\nhell simply because they did not love who God loves. Love everything and\\neveryone He loves.BIBLE IN ONE YEAR: Exodus 1-3AUTHOR: PASTOR E. A. ADEBOYE\\nHYMN 12: I AM THINE OH LORD.1. I am thine, O Lord, I have heard thy voice, and\\nit told thy love to me; but I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer\\ndrawn to thee. Refrain: Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to the cross\\nwhere thou hast died. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord, to thy\\nprecious, bleeding side. 2. Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord, by the\\npower of grace divine; let my soul look up with a steadfast hope, and my will\\nbe lost in thine. (Refrain) 3. O the pure delight of a single hour that before\\nthy throne I spend, when I kneel in prayer, and with thee, my God, I commune\\nas friend with friend! (Refrain) 4. There are depths of love that I cannot\\nknow till I cross the narrow sea; there are heights of joy that I may not\\nreach till I rest in peace with thee. (Refrain)\\n\\n',\n",

Verse 1 of today’s Word says: “And as Jesus passed by,\\nHe saw a man which was blind from his birth.” Wow! That means some battles\\nbegan before you were born. Note: He was blind from birth! It had NOTHING to\\ndo with him! He was not involved in the decision of whether to pass through\\nthat battle or not! Indeed, WE DO NOT CHOOSE OUR CROSSES; THEY CHOOSE US!\\nThere are some specific battles that have been destined for you to go through\\neven before you were born! Did you get that? The day you were BORN was not the\\nday you were CREATED! God created you Himself before your parents even met! So\\nit was planned or programmed for you to goo through that battle, for you to\\ncarry that cross. For 40 years, God watched that man suffer. He watched him\\nabandoned and rejected. Yes! For 40 years he went through a battle he knew\\nnothing about; not because he was a sinner or because he was from a poor home.\\nVs 3 reveals: “…Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents: but that the\\nworks of God should be made manifest in him.” Wow! God just decided to glorify\\nHimself through blindness and through the cross this man was carrying! Watch\\nthis: He created a man, gave him blindness and said, “Through this blindness,\\nI will get glory from you.” Oh! Humanly speaking, it doesn’t make sense and\\nsome battles you are facing do not make sense because His ways are not your\\nways and His thoughts are far from yours. When you don’t understand, just\\ntrust God because He knows the end from the beginning. How do you know that\\nthe battle you are going through is from God?The battle from God will never\\nallow shame to be your last bus-stop. I prophesy: Anything in your life,\\nfamily and ministry that doesn’t make sense now shall announce you by fire in\\nJesus name! REFUSE TO GIVE UP NOW Ah! Any cross my Father has not given to you\\nthis year and beyond shall scatter and backfire. Yes! I speak to that raging\\n2020 battle and that destiny battle you are going through now; you have fasted\\nand prayed, you have sown seeds, and you are giving and forgiving and done all\\nyou know to do; if that battle is allowed by God, I decree: IT WILL NOT SINK\\nYOU BUT WILL PROMOTE, ENLARGE AND ELEVATE YOU THIS YEAR!
