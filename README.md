# Nairaland Question-Answer Dataset and Llama3 Fine-Tuning
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks detailing the process of scraping a Question-Answer dataset from Nairaland and fine-tuning the Llama3 model.


### Model Description

This repository contains the code for fine-tuning the Llama3 model on the Nairaland Question-Answer dataset. The fine-tuned model, [Llama3-8b-Naija_v1](https://huggingface.co/saheedniyi/Llama3-8b-Naija_v1), is tailored for Nigerian English text generation.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used for fine-tuning the model is the [Nairaland Question-Answer Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/saheedniyi/Nairaland_v1_instruct_512QA). It consists of questions and answers scraped from the Nairaland forum.
